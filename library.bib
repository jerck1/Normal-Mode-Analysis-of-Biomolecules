abstract = {Bundles of 10-100 fibers were dissected from the extensor digitorum longus muscle of mouse, mounted in an apparatus for optical recording, and stretched to long sarcomere length (-{\textgreater} 3.6 p{\~{}}m). One fiber within the bundle was microinjected with furaptra, a fluorescent indicator that responds rapidly to changes in myo- plasmic free [Ca 2+ ] (A[Ca2+]). Twitches and brief tetani were initiated by external stimulation. At myoplasmic furaptra concentrations of {\~{}}0.1 mM, the indicator's fluorescence signal during fiber activity (AF/F) was well re- solved. AF/F was converted to A [Ca 2+ ] under the assumption that furaptra's myoplasmic dissociation constant for Ca {\~{}}+ is 98 {\~{}}M at 16{\~{}} and 109 p{\~{}}M at 28{\~{}} At 16{\~{}} the peak amplitude ofA[Ca {\~{}}+] during a twitch was 17.8 -+ 0.4 {\~{}}M (-+SEM; n = 8) and the half-width of A[Ca 2+] was 4.6 +- 0.3 ms. At 28{\~{}} the peak and half-width values were 22.1 - 1.8 {\~{}}zM and 2.0 -+ 0.1 ms, respectively (n = 4). During a brief high-frequency tetanus, individual peaks of A [Ca 2+ ] were also well resolved and reached approximately the same amplitude that resulted from a single shock; the initial decays of A[Ca z+ ] from peak slowed substantially during the tetanus. For a single twitch at 160C, the am- plitude of A [Ca 2+ ] in fast-twitch fibers of mouse is not significantly different from that recently measured in fast- twitch fibers of frog (16.5 {\_}+ 0.9 IxM; Zhao, M., S. Hollingworth, and S.M. Baylor. 1996. Biophys.J. 70:896-916); in contrast, the half-width of A[Ca 2+] is surprisingly brief in mouse fibers, only about half that measured in frog (9.6 + 0.6 ms). The estimated peak rate at which Ca 2+ is released from the sarcoplasmic reticulum in response to an action potential is also similar in mouse and frog, 140-150 I{\~{}}M/ms (16 C)},

abstract = {Abstract Inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate receptors (IP3R) are ubiquitous intracellular Ca2+ channels. They are regulated by IP3 and Ca2+ and can thereby both initiate local Ca2+ release events and regeneratively propagate Ca2+ signals evoked by receptors that stimulate IP3 formation. Local signaling by small numbers of IP3R underpins the utility of IP3-evoked Ca2+ signals as a ubiquitous signaling pathway. The physiological impact of Ca2+ release by very small numbers of IP3R underscores the necessity to understand the behavior of IP3R at the single-channel level. In addition, and in common with analyses of every other ion channel, single-channel analyses have the potential to define the steps linking IP3 binding to channel opening. Patch-clamp recording, by resolving the openings and closings of single channels with exquisite temporal resolution, is the most powerful technique for analysis of single-channel events. It has contributed enormously to the understanding of gating and desensitization/inactivation of numerous ion channels. However, most IP3R reside within intracellular membranes, where they are inaccessible to conventional patch-clamp recording methods. Here, we describe the application of nuclear patch-clamp methods to single-channel analyses of native and recombinant IP3R.},

abstract = {Many insect species have darkly coloured eyes, but distinct colours or patterns are frequently featured. A number of exemplary cases of flies and butterflies are discussed to illustrate our present knowledge of the physical basis of eye colours, their functional background, and the implications for insect colour vision. The screening pigments in the pigment cells commonly determine the eye colour. The red screening pigments of fly eyes and the dorsal eye regions of dragonflies allow stray light to photochemically restore photoconverted visual pigments. A similar role is played by yellow pigment granules inside the photoreceptor cells which function as a light-controlling pupil. Most insect eyes contain black screening pigments which prevent stray light to produce background noise in the photoreceptors. The eyes of tabanid flies are marked by strong metallic colours, due to multilayers in the corneal facet lenses. The corneal multilayers in the gold-green eyes of the deer fly Chrysops relictus reduce the lens transmission in the orange-green, thus narrowing the sensitivity spectrum of photoreceptors having a green absorbing rhodopsin. The tapetum in the eyes of butterflies probably enhances the spectral sensitivity of proximal long-wavelength photoreceptors. Pigment granules lining the rhabdom fine-tune the sensitivity spectra.},

The chapters provide an understanding of calcium buffering and the manipulation of intracellular free calcium concentration in cells. The subtleties and peculiarities of an ion that acts at submicromolar concentrations and that is very actively regulated by cellular buffers and pumps are covered extensively by the early chapters on calcium buffers. The chapter discusses spatially homogeneous calcium sensing and the use of calcium-sensitive electrodes to measure standing fluxes and gradients of calcium. It also explains the state-of-the-art in imaging calcium signals.},

abstract = {Activation of H+ secretion in the intracellular canaliculi of parietal cells occurs on an unknown time scale with ill-defined kinetics for the coupling of H+ secretion and the elevation of intracellular calcium ([Ca2+]i) stimulated by secretagogues.We developed a method to determine H+ secretion in isolated rabbit gastric glands with spatio-temporal resolution, using the fluorescent indicator Lysosensor Yellow-Blue (LYB). Glands accumulated the dye exclusively in the intracellular canaliculi of parietal cells and the gland lumen. Dye fluorescence in the acid spaces of the glands increased upon stimulation of acid secretion by carbachol, histamine and forskolin. Simultaneous fluorescence measurements of acid secretion and [Ca2+]i at 1 s resolution were made by joint loading of LYB and Fluo-3.Carbachol-stimulated H+ secretion was detected in the gland lumen as early as 3 s after the onset of the [Ca2+]i spike. H+ accumulation appeared to be transient and paralleled the release component of the [Ca2+]i spike. Short and repetitive stimulations with carbachol elicited repetitive responses in [Ca2+]i and H+ secretion.Histamine or forskolin stimulated H+ secretion with a delayed onset (around 2 min) and a sustained response. Acid secretion was temporally unrelated to the oscillatory Ca2+ responses.The striking difference in the kinetics of activation of H+ secretion by cholinergic and cAMP-dependent secretagogues indicates that two distinct mechanisms are operating in the final stimulation of the pump, in spite of both eliciting a [Ca2+]i response. },

For FDB two Ca2+ transient morphologies, types I (MT-I, 11 fibres, 19{\%}) and II (MT-II, 47 fibres, 81{\%}), were found, the kinetic parameters (amplitude, rise time, half width, decay time, and time constants of decay) being statistically different. For soleus (n = 20) only MT-I was found, with characteristics similar to MT-I from FDB. Correlations with histochemically determined mATPase, reduced nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide diaphorase and alpha-glycerophosphate dehydrogenase activities, as well as immunostaining and myosin heavy chain electrophoretic analysis of both muscles suggest that signals classified as MT-I may correspond to slow type I and fast IIA fibres while those classified as MT-II may correspond to fast IIX/D fibres. The results point to the importance of Ca2+ signaling for characterization of muscle fibres, but also to its possible role in determining fibre function.},

abstract = {1. Calcium transients were calculated from fura-2 fluorescence signals (corrected for kinetic delays in the Ca(2+)-fura-2 reaction) from single rat skeletal muscle fibres, either fully dissociated from the fast-twitch flexor digitorum brevis (FDB) muscle or in small bundles from the slow-twitch soleus muscle. Fibres or bundles were embedded in agarose gel to inhibit movement and stimulated by single or trains of 1-2 ms electrical pulses (100 Hz, 2-400 ms train duration). 2. The rate constant of decay of [Ca2+] determined from single-exponential fits to the final decay phase of [Ca2+] after a single action potential was considerably faster in FDB fibres than in soleus fibres. As the stimulation duration increased, the rate constant of [Ca2+] decay decreased for both the FDB and soleus fibres, but the effect was greater in FDB than in soleus fibres. 3. Using the magnitude of the decline in the rate constant of [Ca2+] decay with increasing stimulation duration as an index of relative contribution of the saturable Ca2+ binding sites on parvalbumin, subpopulations termed 'high', 'medium' and 'low', referring to estimated parvalbumin content, were determined within each group of FDB and soleus fibres. In fibres assigned to the 'high' and 'medium' groups, parvalbumin was the major contributor (50-73{\%}) to the [Ca2+] decay rate constant after a single action potential. In fibres in the 'low' group, parvalbumin contributed only 0-28{\%} to the rate constant of [Ca2+] decay. 4. Fluorescence recordings using mag-fura-2, a lower-affinity Ca2+ indicator expected to be in equilibrium with myoplasmic Ca2+, gave similar values for both the [Ca2+] decay rate constant after a single action potential and the decrease in this rate constant with increased stimulation duration, as found for the fura-2 [Ca2+] transients from FDB and soleus fibres. Thus, the observed differences in decay rate of Ca2+ were not introduced by kinetic correction of the fura-2 recordings, but are attributed to differences in the Ca2+ binding and transport properties of fast- and slow-twitch mammalian fibres.},

The calcium-binding proteins troponin, parvalbumin, and calsequestrin were present in appropriate locations and with realistic binding kinetics. During activation a time-dependent permeability in the terminal cisternal wall led to calcium release into the myoplasm and its diffusion through the myoplasm longitudinally and radially was computed. After adjustment of three parameters, the model produced a myoplasmic free-calcium concentration that was very similar to those recorded experimentally with calcium indicators. The model has been used (a) to demonstrate the importance of parvalbumin in the relaxation of skeletal muscle, (b) to describe the time course and magnitude of calcium gradients associated with diffusion across the sarcomere, and (c) to estimate the errors associated with the use of aequorin as an intracellular calcium indicator in muscle.},

Here I show that females of the sexually dichromatic species Hypolimnas bolina prefer conspecific males that possess bright iridescent blue/ultraviolet dorsal ornamentation. In separate field and enclosure experiments, using both dramatic and graded wing colour manipulations, I demonstrate that a moderate qualitative reduction in signal brightness and chromaticity has the same consequences as removing the signal entirely.

abstract = {Speciation is generally regarded to result from the splitting of a single lineage. An alternative is hybrid speciation, considered to be extremely rare, in which two distinct lineages contribute genes to a daughter species. Here we show that a hybrid trait in an animal species can directly cause reproductive isolation. The butterfly species Heliconius heurippa is known to have an intermediate morphology and a hybrid genome, and we have recreated its intermediate wing colour and pattern through laboratory crosses between H. melpomene, H. cydno and their F1 hybrids. We then used mate preference experiments to show that the phenotype of H. heurippa reproductively isolates it from both parental species. There is strong assortative mating between all three species, and in H. heurippa the wing pattern and colour elements derived from H. melpomene and H. cydno are both critical for mate recognition by males.},

abstract = {Absorbance spectra were recorded by microspectrophotometry from 39 different rod and cone types representing amphibians. reptiles, and fishes, with A1- or A2-based visual pigments and lambdamax ranging from 357 to 620 nm. The purpose was to investigate accuracy limits of putative universal templates for visual pigment absorbance spectra, and if possible to amend the templates to overcome the limitations. It was found that (1) the absorbance spectrum of frog rhodopsin extract very precisely parallels that of rod outer segments from the same individual, with only a slight hypsochromic shift in lambdamax, hence templates based on extracts are valid for absorbance in situ: (2) a template based on the bovine rhodopsin extract data of Partridge and De Grip (1991) describes the absorbance of amphibian rod outer segments excellently, contrary to recent electrophysiological results; (3) the lambdamax/lambda invariance of spectral shape fails for A1 pigments with small lambdamax and for A2 pigments with large lambdamax, but the deviations are systematic and can be readily incorporated into, for example, the Lamb (1995) template. We thus propose modified templates for the main "alpha-band" of A1 and A2 pigments and show that these describe both absorbance and spectral sensitivities of photoreceptors over the whole range of lambdamax. Subtraction of the alpha-band from the full absorbance spectrum leaves a "beta-band" described by a lambdamax-dependent Gaussian. We conclude that the idea of universal templates (one for A1- and one for A2-based visual pigments) remains valid and useful at the present level of accuracy of data on photoreceptor absorbance and sensitivity. The sum of our expressions for the alpha- and beta-band gives a good description for visual pigment spectra with lambdamax {\textgreater} 350 nm.},

@article{Konishi1991,
abstract = {Furaptra (Raju, B., E. Murphy, L. A. Levy, R. D. Hall, and R. E. London. 1989. Am. J. Physiol. 256:C540-C548) is a "tri-carboxylate" fluorescent indicator with a chromophore group similar to that of fura-2 (Grynkiewicz, G., M. Poenie, and R. Y. Tsien. 1985. J. Biol. Chem. 260:3440-3450). In vitro calibrations indicate that furaptra reacts with Ca2+ and Mg2+ with 1:1 stoichiometry, with dissociation constants of 44 microM and 5.3 mM, respectively (16-17 degrees C; ionic strength, 0.15 M; pH, 7.0). Thus, in a frog skeletal muscle fiber stimulated electrically, the indicator is expected to respond to the change in myoplasmic free [Ca2+] (delta[Ca2+]) with little interference from changes in myoplasmic free [Mg2+]. The apparent longitudinal diffusion constant of furaptra in myoplasm was found to be 0.68 (+/- 0.02, SEM) x 10(-6) cm2 s-1 (16-16.5 degrees C), a value which suggests that about half of the indicator was bound to myoplasmic constituents of large molecular weight. Muscle membranes (surface and/or transverse-tubular) appear to have some permeability to furaptra, as the total quantity of indicator contained within a fiber decreased after injection; the average time constant of the loss was 302 (+/- 145, SEM) min. In fibers containing less than 0.5 mM furaptra and stimulated by a single action potential, the calibrated peak value of delta[Ca2+] averaged 5.1 (+/- 0.3, SEM) microM. This value is about half that reported in the preceding paper (9.4 microM; Konishi, M., and S. M. Baylor. 1991. J. Gen. Physiol. 97:245-270) for fibers injected with purpurate-diacetic acid (PDAA). The latter difference may be explained, at least in part, by the likelihood that the effective dissociation constant of furaptra for Ca2+ is larger in vivo than in vitro, owing to the binding of the indicator to myoplasmic constituents. The time course of furaptra's delta[Ca2+], with average values (+/- SEM) for time to peak and half-width of 6.3 (+/- 0.1) and 9.5 (+/- 0.4) ms, respectively, is very similar to that of delta[Ca2+] recorded with PDAA. Since furaptra's delta[Ca2+] can be recorded at a single excitation wavelength (e.g., 420 nm) with little interference from fiber intrinsic changes, movement artifacts, or delta[Mg2+], furaptra represents a useful myoplasmic Ca2+ indicator, with properties complementary to those of other available indicators.},

abstract = {We used enzymatically dissociated flexor digitorum brevis (FDB) and soleus fibres loaded with the fast Ca                          2+ dye Magfluo-4 AM, and adhered to Laminin, to test whether repetitive stimulation induces progressive changes in the kinetics of Ca                          2+ release and reuptake in a fibre-type-dependent fashion. We applied a protocol of tetani of 350 ms, 100 Hz, every 4 s to reach a mean amplitude reduction of 25{\%} of the first peak. Morphology type I (MT-I) and morphology type II (MT-II) fibres underwent a total of 96 and 52.8 tetani (P {\textless} 0.01 between groups), respectively. The MT-II fibres (n= 18) showed significant reductions of the amplitude (19{\%}), an increase in rise time (8.5{\%}) and a further reduction of the amplitude/rise time ratio (25.5{\%}) of the first peak of the tetanic transient after 40 tetani, while MT-I fibres (n= 5) did not show any of these changes. However, both fibre types showed significant reductions in the maximum rate of rise of the first peak after 40 tetani. Two subpopulations among the MT-II fibres could be distinguished according to Ca                          2+ reuptake changes. Fast-fatigable MT-II fibres (fMT-II) showed an increase of 32.2{\%} in the half-width value of the first peak, while for fatigue-resistant MT-II fibres (rMT-II), the increase amounted to 6.9{\%}, both after 40 tetani. Significant and non-significant increases of 36.4{\%} and 11.9{\%} in the first time constant of decay (t                          1) values were seen after 40 tetani in fMT-II and rMT-II fibres, respectively. MT-I fibres did not show kinetic changes in any of the Ca                          2+ reuptake variables. All changes were reversed after an average recovery of 7.5 and 15.4 min for MT-I and MT-II fibres, respectively. Further experiments ruled out the possibility that the differences in the kinetic changes of the first peak of the Ca                          2+ transients between fibres MT-I and MT-II could be related to the inactivation of Ca                          2+ release mechanism. In conclusion, we established a model of enzymatically dissociated fibres, loaded with Magfluo-4 and adhered to Laminin, to study muscle fatigue and demonstrated fibre-type-dependent, fatigue-induced kinetic changes in both Ca                          2+ release and reuptake. {\textcopyright} 2011 The Authors.

abstract = {We show that naturally occurring chitinous nanostructures found on the wings of the Graphium butterfly can be used as substrates for surface-enhanced Raman scattering when coated with a thin film of gold or silver. The substrates were found to exhibit excellent biocompatibility and sensitivity, making them ideal for protein assaying. An assay using avidin/biotin binding showed that the substrates could be used to quantify protein binding directly from changes in the surface-enhanced Raman scattering (SERS) spectra and were sensitive over a concentration range comparable with a typical enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISA) assay. A biomimetic version of the wing nanostructures produced using a highly reproducible, large-scale fabrication process, yielded comparable enhancement factors and biocompatibility. The excellent biocompatibility of the wings and biomimetic substrates is unparalleled by other lithographically produced substrates, and this could pave the way for widespread application of ultrasensitive SERS-based bioassays.},

Over the past 30 years, optics well known to the physicist have emerged, example after example, in nature. But now the tables are turning and animals are becoming the first stage in the optical design process. Biologists and physicists have begun collaborative optics-based projects where the data will be supplied by nature. The real trigger of this surge in interest is the recent identification of 'photonic crystals' in animals. Animals, it would seem, have plenty to teach us, not only in terms of the design of their optical structures, but also their engineering. A familiar message, perhaps, except now action is underway.},

abstract = {Many butterfly species possess 'structural' colour, where colour is due to optical microstructures found in the wing scales. A number of such structures have been identified in butterfly scales, including three variations on a simple multi-layer structure. In this study, we optically characterize examples of all three types of multi-layer structure, as found in 10 species. The optical mechanism of the suppression and exaggeration of the angle-dependent optical properties (iridescence) of these structures is described. In addition, we consider the phylogeny of the butterflies, and are thus able to relate the optical properties of the structures to their evolutionary development. By applying two different types of analysis, the mechanism of adaptation is addressed. A simple parsimony analysis, in which all evolutionary changes are given an equal weighting, suggests convergent evolution of one structure. A Dollo parsimony analysis, in which the evolutionary 'cost' of losing a structure is less than that of gaining it, implies that 'latent' structures can be reused.},

@article{Briscoe2010,
abstract = {The butterfly Heliconius erato can see from the UV to the red part of the light spectrum with color vision proven from 440 to 640 nm. Its eye is known to contain three visual pigments, rhodopsins, produced by an 11-cis-3-hydroxyretinal chromophore together with long wavelength (LWRh), blue (BRh) and UV (UVRh1) opsins. We now find that H. erato has a second UV opsin mRNA (UVRh2)-a previously undescribed duplication of this gene among Lepidoptera. To investigate its evolutionary origin, we screened eye cDNAs from 14 butterfly species in the subfamily Heliconiinae and found both copies only among Heliconius. Phylogeny-based tests of selection indicate positive selection of UVRh2 following duplication, and some of the positively selected sites correspond to vertebrate visual pigment spectral tuning residues. Epi-microspectrophotometry reveals two UV-absorbing rhodopsins in the H. erato eye with lambda(max) = 355 nm and 398 nm. Along with the additional UV opsin, Heliconius have also evolved 3-hydroxy-DL-kynurenine (3-OHK)-based yellow wing pigments not found in close relatives. Visual models of how butterflies perceive wing color variation indicate this has resulted in an expansion of the number of distinguishable yellow colors on Heliconius wings. Functional diversification of the UV-sensitive visual pigments may help explain why the yellow wing pigments of Heliconius are so colorful in the UV range compared to the yellow pigments of close relatives lacking the UV opsin duplicate.},

abstract = {This paper presents the first evidence of tetrachromacy among invertebrates. The Japanese yellow swallowtail butterfly, Papilio xuthus, uses colour vision when foraging. The retina of Papilio is furnished with eight varieties of spectral receptors of six classes that are the ultraviolet (UV), violet, blue (narrow-band and wide-band), green (single-peaked and double-peaked), red and broad-band classes. We investigated whether all of the spectral receptors are involved in colour vision by measuring the wavelength discrimination ability of foraging Papilio. We trained Papilio to take nectar while seeing a certain monochromatic light. We then let the trained Papilio choose between two lights of different wavelengths and determined the minimum discriminable wavelength difference Deltalambda. The Deltalambda function of Papilio has three minima at approximately 430, 480 and 560nm, where the Deltalambda values approximately 1nm. This is the smallest value found for wavelength discrimination so far, including that of humans. The profile of the Deltalambda function of Papilio can be best reproduced by postulating that the UV, blue (narrow-band and wide-band), green (double-peaked) and red classes are involved in foraging. Papilio colour vision is therefore tetrachromatic.},

abstract = {The geometrical complexity in the wings of several, taxonomically different butterflies, is analyzed in terms of their fractal dimension. Preliminary results provide some evidence on important questions about the (dis)similarity of the wing patterns in terms of their fractal dimension. The analysis is restricted to two groups which are widely used in the literature as typical examples of mimicry, and a small number of unrelated species, thus implying the consideration of only a fraction of the wing pattern diversity. The members of the first mimicry ring, composed by the species Danaus plexippus (better known as the monarch butterfly), and the two subspecies Basilarchia archippus obsoleta (or northern viceroy) and Basilarchia archippus hoffmanni (or tropical viceroy), are found to have a very similar value for the fractal dimension of their wing patterns, even though they do not look very similar at first sight. It is also found that the female of another species (Neophasia terlootii), which looks similar to the members of the previous group, does not share the same feature, while the Lycorea ilione albescens does share it. For the members of the second group of mimicry related butterflies, the Greta nero nero and the Hypoleria cassotis, it is shown that they also have very close values for the fractal dimension of their wing patterns. Finally, it is shown that other species, which apparently have very similar wing patterns, do not have the same fractal dimension. A possible, not completely tested hypothesis is then conjectured: the formation of groups by individuals whose wing patterns have an almost equal fractal dimension may be due to the fact that they do share the same developmental raw material, and that this common feature is posteriorly modified by natural selection, possibly through predation.},

In a honey bee (Apis mellifera) society, the drones use the well-developed dorsal part of the eye to detect the queen against the sky during her nuptial flight. Recently it has become clear that the dorsal area of the drone's eye serves its task by cleverly combining a number of optical mechanisms, thus achieving a high spatial acuity as well as a high sensitivity precisely in the wavelength range of interest--the ultraviolet to blue range. Since the various optical specializations in the drone eye have now been recognized, they can be traced in the eyes of other species: thus, the drone eye serves as a model to give a better understanding of the relationship between structure and function of compound eyes in particular, but also of visual systems in general.},

We describe two methods to quantitatively characterize the optical properties of the individual scales in those structurally colored butterflies. Owing to the small dimensions of the scale and to the fact that the reflection and transmission are very diffuse, it is generally difficult to accurately measure the reflectance and transmittance. To overcome these difficulties, we have carefully constructed an optical system including an integrating sphere and investigated variously colored nine kinds of scale. It is shown that the obtained spectra clearly characterize the optical differences among those structurally colored scales and also the differences between structural and pigmentary colors. Further, we have performed the angle-resolved measurement of the reflected light to characterize the spatial pattern of reflection, which is closely related to the mechanism of reflection.},

It is based on feedback adjustment of light intensity to obtain constant peak-to-peak amplitudes of response to a flickering stimulus as the spectrum is scanned between 300 and 700 nm in 4 nm steps. It combines the advantages of: (1) on-line presentation of S(lambda) curves; (2) constant light adaptation; (3) sampling of many points; and (4) fast data collection time.

Since the colour pattern of a butterfly wing is formed as a mosaic of differently coloured scales, several questions naturally arise: are the microstructures the same between the blue and white scales? How is the distinctive whiteness produced, structurally or by means of pigmentation? To answer these questions, we have performed structural and optical investigations of the stripe pattern of a butterfly, Morpho cypris. It is found that besides the dorsal and ventral scale layers, the wing substrate also has the corresponding stripe pattern. Quantitative optical measurements and analysis using a simple model for the wing structure reveal the origin of the higher reflectance which makes the white stripe brighter.},

abstract = {Experiments were carried out to compare the amplitude and time course of Ca2+ release from the sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) in intact slow-twitch and fast-twitch mouse fibres. Individual fibres within small bundles were injected with furaptra, a low-affinity, rapidly responding Ca2+ indicator. In response to a single action potential at 16 degrees C, the peak amplitude and half-duration of the change in myoplasmic free Ca2+ (DeltaCa2+) differed significantly between fibre types (slow-twitch: peak amplitude, 9.4 1.0 microM (mean S.E.M.); half-duration, 7.7 0.6 ms; fast-twitch: peak amplitude 18.5 0.5 microM; half-duration, 4.9 0.3 ms). SR Ca2+ release was estimated from DeltaCa2+ with a computational model that calculated Ca2+ binding to the major myoplasmic Ca2+ buffers (troponin, ATP and parvalbumin); buffer concentrations and reaction rate constants were adjusted to reflect fibre-type differences. In response to an action potential, the total concentration of released Ca2+ (DeltaCaT) and the peak rate of Ca2+ release ((d/dt)DeltaCaT) differed about 3-fold between the fibre types (slow-twitch: DeltaCaT, 127 7 microM; (d/dt)DeltaCaT, 70 6 microM ms-1; fast-twitch: DeltaCaT, 346 6 microM; (d/dt)DeltaCaT, 212 4 microM ms-1). In contrast, the half-duration of (d/dt)DeltaCaT was very similar in the two fibre types (slow-twitch, 1.8 0.1 ms; fast-twitch, 1.6 0.0 ms). When fibres were stimulated with a 5-shock train at 67 Hz, the peaks of (d/dt)DeltaCaT in response to the second and subsequent shocks were much smaller than that due to the first shock; the later peaks, expressed as a fraction of the amplitude of the first peak, were similar in the two fibre types (slow-twitch, 0.2-0.3; fast-twitch, 0.1-0.3). The results support the conclusion that individual SR Ca2+ release units function similarly in slow-twitch and fast-twitch mammalian fibres.},

The dynamic behavior of CRNs can be investigated by solving the polynomial equations derived from its structure. However, simple CRN give rise to non-linear polynomials that are difficult to resolve. Here we propose a procedure to locate the steady states of CRNs from a formula derived through algebraic geometry methods. We have applied this procedure to define the steady states of a classic CRN that exhibits instability, and to a model of programmed cell death.},

@article{Briscoe2008,
abstract = {The eyes of butterflies are remarkable, because they are nearly as diverse as the colors of wings. Much of eye diversity can be traced to alterations in the number, spectral properties and spatial distribution of the visual pigments. Visual pigments are light-sensitive molecules composed of an opsin protein and a chromophore. Most butterflies have eyes that contain visual pigments with a wavelength of peak absorbance, lambda(max), in the ultraviolet (UV, 300-400 nm), blue (B, 400-500 nm) and long wavelength (LW, 500-600 nm) part of the visible light spectrum, respectively, encoded by distinct UV, B and LW opsin genes. In the compound eye of butterflies, each individual ommatidium is composed of nine photoreceptor cells (R1-9) that generally express only one opsin mRNA per cell, although in some butterfly eyes there are ommatidial subtypes in which two opsins are co-expressed in the same photoreceptor cell. Based on a phylogenetic analysis of opsin cDNAs from the five butterfly families, Papilionidae, Pieridae, Nymphalidae, Lycaenidae and Riodinidae, and comparative analysis of opsin gene expression patterns from four of the five families, I propose a model for the patterning of the ancestral butterfly eye that is most closely aligned with the nymphalid eye. The R1 and R2 cells of the main retina expressed UV-UV-, UV-B- or B-B-absorbing visual pigments while the R3-9 cells expressed a LW-absorbing visual pigment. Visual systems of existing butterflies then underwent an adaptive expansion based on lineage-specific B and LW opsin gene multiplications and on alterations in the spatial expression of opsins within the eye. Understanding the molecular sophistication of butterfly eye complexity is a challenge that, if met, has broad biological implications.},

abstract = {A large number of techniques have been applied to monitor the function of free metal ions in biological systems. Fluorescent ion probes have evolved into an extremely useful tool for contemporary experimentalists. Polycarboxylate indicators are widely used in the determination of metal ion concentrations, especially due to their cell membrane permeability. The design of these probes required detailed knowledge in related fields of medicine, biology, and chemistry, and their preparation demanded the expertise of organic synthesis. In this review, the basic rationale for the selection of particular chemical structures are analyzed, synthetic pathways leading to the desired structures are presented, often via a retrosynthetic approach, and properties and relative advantages of the use of these probes are described. References to specific applications are limited, given the large number of reviews on related subjects. Topics such as those related to dextran conjugates that are broad enough to be the subject of a different review are not included, and leakage resistance and near-membrane probes are mentioned briefly in separate sections, although these are chemically similar to typical polycarboxylate dyes. While reference to topics mentioned in related reviews is unavoidable, presentation of material in this review is from the point of view of a medicinal chemist rather than that of the many experts using these pioneering techniques.},

The scales of the pierids Pieris rapae and Delias nigrina scatter white light randomly, in close agreement with Lambert's cosine law, which can be well understood from the randomly organized beads on the scale crossribs. The reflectance of the iridescent blue scales of Morpho aega is determined by multilayer structures in the scale ridges, causing diffraction in approximately a plane. The purple scales in the dorsal wing tips of the male Colotis regina act similarly as the Morpho scale in the blue, due to multilayers in the ridges, but the scattering in the red occurs as in the Pieris scale, because the scales contain beads with pigment that does not absorb in the red wavelength range. The green-yellow scales of Urania fulgens backscatter light in a narrow spatial angle, because of a multilayer structure in the scale body.},

@article{Baylor1998,
abstract = {Cannell and Allen (1984. Biophys. J. 45:913925) introduced the use of a multi-compartment model to estimate the time course of spread of calcium ions (Ca2+) within a half sarcomere of a frog skeletal muscle fiber activated by an action potential. Under the assumption that the sites of sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) Ca2+ release are located radially around each myofibril at the Z line, their model calculated the spread of released Ca2+ both along and into the half sarcomere. During diffusion, Ca2+ was assumed to react with metal-binding sites on parvalbumin (a diffusible Ca2+- and Mg2+-binding protein) as well as with fixed sites on troponin. We have developed a similar model, but with several modifications that reflect current knowledge of the myoplasmic environment and SR Ca2+ release. We use a myoplasmic diffusion constant for free Ca2+ that is twofold smaller and an SR Ca2+ release function in response to an action potential that is threefold briefer than used previously. Additionally, our model includes the effects of Ca2+ and Mg2+ binding by adenosine 5-triphosphate (ATP) and the diffusion of Ca2+-bound ATP (CaATP). Under the assumption that the total myoplasmic concentration of ATP is 8 mM and that the amplitude of SR Ca2+ release is sufficient to drive the peak change in free Ca2+ ($\Delta$Ca2+) to 18 $\mu$M (the approximate spatially averaged value that is observed experimentally), our model calculates that (a) the spatially averaged peak increase in CaATP is 64 $\mu$M; (b) the peak saturation of troponin with Ca2+ is high along the entire thin filament; and (c) the half-width of $\Delta$Ca2+ is consistent with that observed experimentally. Without ATP, the calculated half-width of spatially averaged $\Delta$Ca2+ is abnormally brief, and troponin saturation away from the release sites is markedly reduced. We conclude that Ca2+ binding by ATP and diffusion of CaATP make important contributions to the determination of the amplitude and the time course of $\Delta$Ca2+.},

abstract = {The bright green dorsal iridescence of the hindwings of Neurobasis chinensis chinensis males, very rare in Odonata, is known to play a significant role in their courtship behaviour. The mechanism responsible for such high contrast and spectrally pure colour has been investigated and found to be optical interference, producing structural colour from distinct laminations in the wing membrane cuticle. The ventral sides of these iridescent wings are dark brown in colour. In a single continuous membrane of wing cuticle, this is an effect that requires a specialized structure. It is accomplished through the presence of high optical absorption (kappa = 0.13) within two thick layers near the ventral surface of the wing, which leads to superior dorsal colour characteristics. By simultaneously fitting five sets of optical reflectivity and transmissivity spectra to theory, we were able to extract very accurate values of the complex refractive index for all three layer types present in the wing. The real parts of these are n = 1.47, 1.68 and 1.74. Although there is often similarly significant dorsal and ventral colour contrast in other structurally coloured natural systems, very few system designs comprise only a single continuous membrane.},

abstract = {Bundles of 10-100 fibers were dissected from the extensor digitorum longus muscle of mouse, mounted in an apparatus for optical recording, and stretched to long sarcomere length or = 3.6 microns). One fiber within the bundle was microinjected with furaptra, a fluorescent indicator that responds rapidly to changes in myoplasmic free Ca2+ (delta Ca2+). Twitches and brief tetani were initiated by external stimulation. At myoplasmic furaptra concentrations of approximately 0.1 mM, the indicator's fluorescence signal during fiber activity (delta F/F) was well resolved. delta F/F was converted to delta Ca2+ under the assumption that furaptra's myoplasmic dissociation constant for Ca2+ is 98 microM at 16 degrees C and 109 microM at 28 degrees C. At 16 degrees C, the peak amplitude of delta Ca2+ during a twitch was 17.8 0.4 microM (+/-SEM; n = 8) and the half-width of delta Ca2+ was 4.6 0.3 ms. At 28 degrees C, the peak and half-width values were 22.1 1.8 microM and 2.0 0.1 ms, respectively (n = 4). During a brief high-frequency tetanus, individual peaks of delta Ca2+ were also well resolved and reached approximately the same amplitude that resulted from a single shock; the initial decays of delta Ca2+ from peak slowed substantially during the tetanus. For a single twitch at 16 degrees C, the amplitude of delta Ca2+ in fast-twitch fibers of mouse is not significantly different from that recently measured in fast- twitch fibers of frog (16.5 0.9 microM; Zhao, M., S. Hollingworth, and S.M. Baylor. 1996. Biophys. J. 70:896-916); in contrast, the half- width of delta Ca2+ is surprisingly brief in mouse fibers, only about half that measured in frog (9.6 0.6 ms). The estimated peak rate at which Ca2+ is released from the sarcoplasmic reticulum in response to an action potential is also similar in mouse and frog, 140-150 microM/ms (16 degrees C).},

abstract = {Males of Chrysozephyrus smaragdinus were active from late morning to late afternoon, during which they showed territorial behavior, perhaps for mating. The territorial male stayed in a particular area and occasionally flew around it, referred to hereafter as the inspection area. When other male intruded into this area, the territorial male rushed to him. Then, they engaged in a circling flight regarded as a "war of attrition". During this flight, the two males sometimes strayed far away from the territory. After the circling flight, the resident returned to his territory in almost all cases (98{\%}). Despite such intrusions, many residents defended their territory for several successive days. This suggests strongly the "effect of prior residence". We recorded the circling flights with a high-speed video camera, and confirmed that the male that ceased the circling flight first was the loser. This finding gave some validity to consider circling flight as wars of attrition. In a few cases, the territorial male mated with a female that came to the territory. These once mated males held the territory no longer, suggesting that mating experience should restrict the next mating opportunity in this species.},

abstract = {Abstract The patch clamp technique, which was introduced by Neher and Sakmann and their colleagues in 1981, has allowed electrophysiologists to record ion channel activity from most mammalian cell types. When well-established precautions are taken to minimize electrical and mechanical fluctuations, current transients as small as 0.5 pA and as brief as 0.5 ms can be measured reliably in cell-attached patches of plasma membrane with a polished glass pipette when it forms a giga-ohm seal with the membrane. In many cases, this is sufficient to watch individual channel proteins open and close repeatedly in real time on metabolically intact cells. No other technique currently provides a more precise or detailed view of the function and regulation of calcium channel gating. If antibiotics are added to the pipette to permeabilize the membrane underneath to small monovalent cations, thereby allowing the entire cell to be voltage-clamped without disrupting its contents, the integrated activity of all the calcium channels in the surface membrane can be measured.},

abstract = {Tropical Morpho butterflies are famous for their brilliant iridescent colours, which arise from ordered arrays of scales on their wings. Here we show that the iridescent scales of the Morpho sulkowskyi butterfly give a different optical response to different individual vapours, and that this optical response dramatically outperforms that of existing nano-engineered photonic sensors. The reflectance spectra of the scales provide information about the nature and concentration of the vapours, allowing us to identify a range of closely related vapours–water, methanol, ethanol and isomers of dichloroethylene when they are analysed individually. By comparing the reflectance as a function of time for different vapours, we deduce that wing regions with scale structures of differing spatial periodicity give contributions to the overall spectral response at different wavelengths. Our optical model explains the effect of different components of the wing scales on the vapour response, and could steer the design of new man-made optical gas sensors.},

abstract = {It is well known that the wing scales of butterflies and moths have elaborated microstructures that cause various optical effects. Structural colors occur when the microstructures have a size comparable with the wavelength of light. On the other hand, the wing scales of some species are structurally modified at a size much larger size than the light wavelength. Here we show for the Madagascan sunset moth that not only the microstructures but also the large-size modifications can play an important role in scale coloration. The wing of the sunset moth shows a striking iridescence that is caused by the air-cuticle multilayer structure inside the wing scales. Further, the scale itself is highly curved from its root to distal end. Owing to this strong curvature, a deep groove structure is formed between adjacent two rows of the regularly arranged scales. We find that this groove structure together with multilayer optical interference produces an unusual optical effect through an inter-scale reflection mechanism; the wing color changes depending on light polarization. A model is proposed that quantitatively describes this color change.},

An extensive measurement of the back-scattering of visible light from butterfly scales was performed for various angles of incidence. Efficient low-pass filter behaviour was observed for all angles of incidence and polarizations, with near-complete transmission at wavelengths above the threshold of 550 nm. The angular spread of the back-scattered light was found to be organized in lobes with total extinction of the specular reflection for all conditions of incidence. Retro-reflector behaviour was also observed for angles of incidence of 30 degrees and above. Additionally, the role of periodic geometrical features found in the microstructure for the generation of its spectral response was analysed theoretically. Using finite-difference time-domain and near-field to far-field transformation techniques, the back-scattering of visible light by models was computed numerically and the relevance of geometrical features for the production of structural colour and diffraction was demonstrated.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Colour is a consequence of the optical properties of an object and the visual system of the animal perceiving it. Colour is produced through chemical and structural means, but structural colour has been relatively poorly studied in plants.

SCOPE: This Botanical Briefing describes the mechanisms by which structures can produce colour. In plants, as in animals, the most common mechanisms are multilayers and diffraction gratings. The functions of structural colour are then discussed. In animals, these colours act primarily as signals between members of the same species, although they can also play roles in camouflaging animals from their predators. In plants, multilayers are found predominantly in shade-plant leaves, suggesting a role either in photoprotection or in optimizing capture of photosynthetically active light. Diffraction gratings may be a surprisingly common feature of petals, and recent work has shown that they can be used by bees as cues to identify rewarding flowers.

CONCLUSIONS: Structural colour may be surprisingly frequent in the plant kingdom, playing important roles alongside pigment colour. Much remains to be discovered about its distribution, development and function.},

abstract = {Iridescent structural colour is found in a wide variety of organisms. In birds, the mechanisms that create these colours are diverse, but all are based on ordered arrays of melanin granules within a keratin substrate in barbules. The feathers of the grackles and allies in the family Icteridae range in appearance from matte black to iridescent. In a phylogenetic analysis of this clade, we identified several evolutionary transitions between these colour states. To describe a possible mechanistic explanation for the lability of plumage coloration, we used spectrometry, transmission electron microscopy and thin-film optical modelling of the feathers of 10 icterid species from five genera, including taxa with matte black or iridescent feathers. In matte black species, melanin was densely packed in barbules, while in iridescent species, melanin granules were arranged in ordered layers around the edges of barbules. The structured arrangement of melanin granules in iridescent species created optical interfaces, which are shown by our optical models to be critical for iridescent colour production by coherent scattering. These data imply that rearrangement of melanin granules in barbules is a mechanism for shifts between black and iridescent colours, and that the relative simplicity of this mechanism may explain the lability of plumage colour state within this group.},

As expected, divergent selection clearly can couple with gene flow to maintain color polymorphism and mediate speciation. More surprisingly, recent evidence suggests that diverse forms of within-population sexual selection can generate negative frequency dependence and initiate reproductive isolation. These findings deserve additional study, particularly concerning the roles of heterogeneous visual environments and correlational selection. Finally, comparative studies and more comprehensive approaches are required to elucidate when color polymorphism evolves, persists, or leads to speciation.},

abstract = {Combinations of microstructural and pigmentary components of barbs create the colour displays of feathers. It follows that evolutionary changes in colour displays must reflect changes in the underlying production mechanisms, but rarely have the mechanisms of feather colour evolution been studied. Among bluebirds in the genus Sialia, male rump colour varies among species from dark blue to light blue while breast colour varies from blue to rusty. We use spectrometry, transmission electron microscopy and Fourier analysis to identify the morphology responsible for these divergent colour displays. The morphology of blue rump barbs is similar among the three species, with an outer keratin cortex layer surrounding a medullary 'spongy layer' and a basal row of melanin granules. A spongy layer is also present in blue breast barbs of mountain bluebirds Sialia currucoides and in rusty breast barbs of western Sialia mexicana and eastern bluebirds Sialia sialis. In blue barbs melanin is basal to the spongy layer, but is not present in the outer cortex or spongy layer, while in rusty barbs, melanin is present only in the cortex. The placement of melanin in the cortex masks expression of structural blue, creating a rusty display. Such shifts in microstructures and pigments may be widespread mechanisms for the evolutionary changes in the colours of feathers and other reflective structures across colourful organisms.},

abstract = {Brilliant iridescent colouring in male butterflies enables long-range conspecific communication and it has long been accepted that microstructures, rather than pigments, are responsible for this coloration. Few studies, however, explicitly relate the intra-scale microstructures to overall butterfly visibility, both in terms of reflected and transmitted intensities and viewing angles. Using a focused-laser technique, we investigated the absolute reflectivity and transmissivity associated with the single-scale microstructures of two species of Morpho butterfly and the mechanisms behind their remarkable wide-angle visibility. Measurements indicate that certain Morpho microstructures reflect up to 75{\%} of the incident blue light over an angle range of greater than 100{\{}degrees{\}} in one plane and 15{\{}degrees{\}} in the other. We show that incorporation of a second layer of more transparent scales, above a layer of highly iridescent scales, leads to very strong diffraction, and we suggest this effect acts to increase further the angle range over which incident light is reflected. Measurements using index-matching techniques yield the complex refractive index of the cuticle material comprising the single-scale microstructure to be n = (1.56+0.01) + (0.06 {\{}+/-{\}}0.01)i. This figure is required for theoretical modelling of such microstructure systems.},

abstract = {A wave-optical model for the integrated facet lens-rhabdomere system of fly eyes is used to calculate the effective light power in the rhabdomeres when the eye is illuminated with a point light source or with an extended source. Two rhabdomere types are considered: the slender rhabdomeres of R7,8 photoreceptors and the wider, but tapering R1-6 rhabdomeres. The angular sensitivities of the two rhabdomere types have been calculated as a function of F-number and wavelength by fitting Gaussian functions to the effective light power. For a given F-number, the angular sensitivity broadens with wavelength for the slender rhabdomeres, but it stays approximately constant for the wider rhabdomeres. The integrated effective light power increases with the rhabdomere diameter, but it is for both rhabdomere types nearly independent of the light wavelength and F-number. The results are used to interpret the small F-number of Drosophila facet lenses. Presumably the small head puts a limit to the size of the facet lens and favors a short focal length.},

The corneal nipple array and the tapetum, optical structures that many but not all butterflies share with moths, suggest that moths are ancestral to butterflies, in agreement with molecular phylogeny. A basic set of ultraviolet-, blue- and green-sensitive receptors, encountered among nymphalid butterflies, forms the basis for trichromatic vision. Screening pigments surrounding the light-receiving rhabdoms can modify the spectral sensitivity of the photoreceptors so that the sensitivity peak is in the violet, yellow, red, or even deep-red, specifically in swallowtails (Papilionidae) and whites (Pieridae), thus enhancing color discriminability. The photoreceptor sensitivity spectra are presumably tuned to the wing colors of conspecific butterflies.},

Reflectance and transmittance measurements of single scales indicate that the cream and orange scales contain papiliochrome pigments, while brown, black and blue scales contain melanin. Microspectrophotometry and scatterometry of both sides of the wing scales show that the lower lamina acts as a thin film, with reflection properties dependent on the scale's pigmentation. Notably in the orange scales, the reflectance spectrum of the lower lamina is tuned to the pigment's absorbance spectrum. The dorsal hindwings of the male (but not the female) B. philenor are blue-green iridescent. At oblique illumination, the light reflected by the male's dorsal hindwings can be highly polarised, which may have a function in intersexual signalling.},

abstract = {The color-pattern determination of butterfly wings was studied, focusing on the cold-shock-induced color-pattern modifications of a species of butterfly, Vanessa (Cynthia) cardui (Lepidoptera: Nymphalidae). It was shown that the modification property could be transferred to the noncold-shocked individuals by the transfusion of hemolymph taken from the cold-shocked individuals, suggesting the existence of an unknown diffusible factor or hormone, induced or activated by the cold shock. The involvement of a receptor tyrosine kinase for the color-pattern modifications was tested by the simple application of some oxyanions such as sodium tungstate, sodium molybdate, and molybdic acid to pupae, since these oxyanions have been known to up-regulate the process of phosphorylation via receptor tyrosine kinases in general. It was shown that they could modify the wing color-pattern in a way very similar to the cold shock. Moreover, the topical applications of sodium tungstate or molybdic acid induced large ectopic black spots on the treated pupal wings. Among the treatment methods, the sodium tungstate treatment was by far more effective than the cold shock treatment itself. Taken together, these data suggest that an unknown cold-shock hormone activates the process of phosphorylation via a receptor tyrosine kinase necessary for the color-pattern development.},

abstract = {The AM loading of a number of different fluorescent Ca2+ indicators was compared in intact single fibers of frog muscle. Among the 13 indicators studied, loading rates (the average increase in the fiber concentration of indicator per first 60 min of loading) varied approximately 100-fold, from approximately 3 microM/h to {\textgreater}300 microM/h (16 degrees C). Loading rates were strongly dependent on the molecular weight of the AM compounds, with the rate increasing steeply as molecular weight decreased below approximately 850. Properties of delta F/F (the Ca2(+)-related fluorescence signal observed with fiber stimulation) were also measured in AM-loaded fibers and compared with those previously reported for fibers microinjected with indicator. In general, the time course of delta F/F was very similar with AM-loading and microinjection; however, the amplitude of delta F/F was usually smaller with AM-loading. There was a strong correlation between the rate of indicator loading and the value of the parameter f (the ratio of the amplitude of delta F/F in AM-loaded versus microinjected fibers). For indicators with small loading rates (100 microM/h, N = 4), f values were large or =0.8, N = 4). This suggests that, with any AM indicator, a small concentration may associate nonspecifically with the fiber (either the indicator is incompletely de-esterified or, if completely de-esterified, not located in the myoplasmic compartment). If the loaded concentration is small, the nonspecific indicator will present a significant source of error in the estimation of Ca2+i.},

abstract = {Fluorescence signals from the calcium sensitive dyes Fluo-3 or Rhod-2 were obtained simultaneously with isometric tension in single fibres isolated from the anterior tibialis muscle of Leptodactylus insularis (20-22 degrees C). Fluo-3 fluorescence signals were transformed into Ca2+i transients as previously described. Most of the decay phase of single twitch transient is well fitted by a single exponential (tau of about 10 ms), followed by a slower declining component lasting tens of milliseconds. During short periods, 10 to 20 s, of low frequency stimulation, between 0.2 and 5 Hz, the basal Ca2+i increased slowly from 0.1 to about 0.4 microM, with only minor changes in the exponentially decaying phase. In fibres poisoned with thapsigargin or cyclopiazonic acid (1-2 microM) the tau of decay of fluorescence or Ca2+ transients of single twitches was very similar to that observed in non-poisoned fibres. Nevertheless, in poisoned fibres challenged with repetitive stimulation. the tau of Ca2+ transients decay increased from about 10 ms to {\textgreater}40 ms, while the basal Ca2+i increased from 0.1 to 2 microM. Short rest periods (about 5 min) could reverse these effects, indicating that they were not a direct consequence of SR Ca 2+ -ATPase inhibition. The correlation coefficient between tau of decay and basal Ca2+i was {\textgreater}0.8 (P{\textless}0.0001). Qualitatively similar results were obtained measuring Rhod-2 fluorescence signals. A lumped, two-compartment model could account for these results. Loading the fibres with EGTA-AM, diminished the effects of prolonged stimulation observed in poisoned fibres. Moreover, we show that the Na+ - Ca2+ exchange mechanism does not participate appreciably in fast Ca2+ removal.},

abstract = {1. The calcium-sensitive dye fluo-3 AM was used to obtain fluorescence signals and calcium transients associated with K+ contractures, twitches and tetani, in intact single muscle fibres of the tropical toad Leptodactylus insularis. 2. The changes in free calcium concentration in the myoplasm (Ca2+i) were calculated using the values of the 'off' (k- = 33.5 s-1) and 'on' (k+ = 13.1 microM-1 s-1) rate constants for the binding of calcium to the dye (dissociation constant, Kd = k-/k+). The mean (+/- S.E.M., n = 7) peak Ca2+i value during twitches or tetani was 3.9 0.3 or 4.1 0.3 microM, respectively, while during maximal K+ contractures, it was 10.3 0.8 microM. The threshold Ca2+i for tension development was about 1 microM. 3. For responses elicited with high K+o (80-190 mM), the calcium transients decayed faster than tension. At lower K+o (30-70 mM), the decay was slower, and relaxation was complete when Ca2+i was still above contractile threshold values. 4. Following a K+ contracture, recovery of the calcium transients associated with twitches occurred before recovery of tension, indicating an apparent dissociation between Ca2+i and tension output. This apparent dissociation between calcium and tension output could be attributed to the desensitization of the contractile proteins to calcium, or, more probably, to the non-uniform behaviour of calcium release and/or uptake sites, leading to an unhomogeneous distribution of active sarcomeres along the fibre length and localized sarcomere relaxation.},

We applied a protocol of tetani of 350 ms, 100 Hz, every 4 s to reach a mean amplitude reduction of 25{\%} of the first peak. Morphology type I (MT-I) and morphology type II (MT-II) fibres underwent a total of 96 and 52.8 tetani (P {\textless} 0.01 between groups), respectively. The MT-II fibres (n = 18) showed significant reductions of the amplitude (19{\%}), an increase in rise time (8.5{\%}) and a further reduction of the amplitude/rise time ratio (25.5{\%}) of the first peak of the tetanic transient after 40 tetani, while MT-I fibres (n = 5) did not show any of these changes. However, both fibre types showed significant reductions in the maximum rate of rise of the first peak after 40 tetani. Two subpopulations among the MT-II fibres could be distinguished according to Ca(2+) reuptake changes. Fast-fatigable MT-II fibres (fMT-II) showed an increase of 32.2{\%} in the half-width value of the first peak, while for fatigue-resistant MT-II fibres (rMT-II), the increase amounted to 6.9{\%}, both after 40 tetani. Significant and non-significant increases of 36.4{\%} and 11.9{\%} in the first time constant of decay (t(1)) values were seen after 40 tetani in fMT-II and rMT-II fibres, respectively. MT-I fibres did not show kinetic changes in any of the Ca(2+) reuptake variables. All changes were reversed after an average recovery of 7.5 and 15.4 min for MT-I and MT-II fibres, respectively. Further experiments ruled out the possibility that the differences in the kinetic changes of the first peak of the Ca(2+) transients between fibres MT-I and MT-II could be related to the inactivation of Ca(2+) release mechanism. In conclusion, we established a model of enzymatically dissociated fibres, loaded with Magfluo-4 and adhered to Laminin, to study muscle fatigue and demonstrated fibre-type-dependent, fatigue-induced kinetic changes in both Ca(2+) release and reuptake.},

abstract = {Colour patterns of animals' bodies are usually produced by the spatial distribution of pigments with different colours. However, some animals use the spatial variation of colour-producing microstructures. We have studied one distinctive example of such structurally produced colour patterns, the wing of the Madagascan sunset moth, to clarify the physical rules that underlie the colour variation. It is known that the iridescent wing scale of the sunset moth has the alternate air-cuticle multilayer structure that causes optical interference. The microscopic and optical investigations of various parts of the wing have confirmed that the thickness of the cuticle layers within the scale largely varies to produce the colour pattern. However, it varies in very different ways between the dorsal and ventral sides of the hind wing; the thickness gradually varies on the dorsal side from scale to scale, while the abrupt changes are found on the ventral side to form distinctive borders between differently coloured areas. It is also revealed that an unusual coloration mechanism is involved in the green part of the ventral hind wing: the colour is caused by higher order optical interference of the highly non-ideal multilayer structure. The physical mechanism of the colour pattern formation is briefly discussed with the several mathematical models proposed so far.},

Its fluorescence signal (excitation 339 nm, emission 492 nm) increases about fivefold going from Ca-free to CA- saturated forms. Cells are loaded with quin2 by incubation with its acetoxymethyl ester, which readily permeates the membrane and is hydrolyzed in the cytoplasm, thus trapping the impermeant quin2 there. The intracellular quin2 appears to be free in cytoplasm, not bound to membranes and not sequestered inside organelles. The fluorescence signal from resting cells indicates a Ca2+i of near 120 nM. The millimolar loadings of quin2 needed for accurately calibrated signals do not seem to perturb steady-state Ca2+i, but do somewhat slow or blunt Ca2+i transients. Loadings of up to 2mM are without serious toxic effects, though above this level some lowering of cellular ATP is observed. Ca2+i was well stabilized in the face of large changes in external Ca2+. Alterations of Na+ gradients, membrane potential, or intracellular pH had little effect. Mitochondrial poisons produced a small increase in Ca2+i, probably due mostly to the effects of severe ATP depletion on the plasma membrane. Thus intracellulary trapped chelators like quin2 offer a method to measure or buffer Ca2+i in hitherto intractable cell types.},

abstract = {The color of natural objects depends on how they are structured and pigmented. In flowers, both the surface structure of the petals and the pigments they contain determine coloration. The aim of the present study was to assess the contribution of structural coloration, including iridescence, to overall floral coloration. We studied the reflection characteristics of flower petals of various plant species with an imaging scatterometer, which allows direct visualization of the angle dependence of the reflected light in the hemisphere above the petal. To separate the light reflected by the flower surface from the light backscattered by the components inside (e.g. the vacuoles), we also investigated surface casts. A survey among angiosperms revealed three different types of floral surface structure, each with distinct reflections. Petals with a smooth and very flat surface had mirror-like reflections and petal surfaces with cones yielded diffuse reflections. Petals with striations yielded diffraction patterns when single cells were illuminated. The iridescent signal, however, vanished when illumination similar to that found in natural conditions was applied. Pigmentary rather than structural coloration determines the optical appearance of flowers. Therefore, the hypothesized signaling by flowers with striated surfaces to attract potential pollinators presently seems untenable.},

Many animals in most phyla have since then been shown to have colour vision. Colour is used for specific behaviours, such as phototaxis and object recognition, while other behaviours such as motion detection are colour blind. Having established the existence of colour vision, research focussed on the question of how many spectral types of photoreceptors are involved. Recently, data on photoreceptor spectral sensitivities have been combined with behavioural experiments and physiological models to study systematically the next logical question: 'what neural interactions underlie colour vision?' This review gives an overview of the methods used to study animal colour vision, and discusses how quantitative modelling can suggest how photoreceptor signals are combined and compared to allow for the discrimination of biologically relevant stimuli.},

abstract = {Abstract Detection and measurement of intracellular calcium concentration ([Ca2+]i) have relied on various methods, the popularity of which depends on their ease of use and applicability to different cell types. Historically, Ca2+-selective electrodes have been used concomitantly with absorption indicators such as arsenazo-III, but their interest has been eclipsed by the introduction of a large number of fluorescent calcium probes with calcium sensitivities varying from the nanomolar to the micromolar range such as fura-2, indo-1, fluo-4, and many others. In this chapter, we emphasize the utility of Ca2+-selective electrodes and show that their use is complementary to use of fluorescent indicators; indeed, each method has advantages and disadvantages. We first describe the preparation and application of Ca2+-selective minielectrodes based on the Ca2+ ligand ETH 129 (Schefer et al., 1986) that have a larger dynamic range and faster response time than most commercially available calcium electrodes. The second part of the chapter is dedicated to ETH 129-based Ca2+-selective microelectrodes (MEs), and their application in the determination of [Ca2+]i in cardiac cells. Since numerous reviews and books have been dedicated to the theoretical aspects of ion-selective ME principles and technology, this chapter is not intended for investigators who have no experience with MEs.},

As the dorsal wing surface of males showed a strong reflectance when the specimen was tilted, measurements were made by the tilting method. The dorsal wing surface of males which appears green to the human eye reflected UV (315-350 nm) as well as green light (530-550 nm). The reflectance rate of UV to visible green light varied among species with a higher rate for C. hisamatsusanus and C. ataxus, and a lower rate for C. smaragdinus and C. brillantinus. The peak wavelength and the peak height did not shift when the specimen was exposed to direct sunlight at least for 16 hr. Artificial removal of scales by scratching the wing surface decreased reflectance. Blue marks on the forewings of C. brillantinus, C. hisamatsusanus and C. ataxus females reflected UV to visible light of short wavelength, and orange marks on the dorsal surface of the forewing and the ventral surface of the hindwing of C. samaragdinus females showed a higher reflectance at longer wavelengths.},

We describe two methods to quantitatively characterize the optical properties of the individual scales in those structurally colored butterflies. Owing to the small dimensions of the scale and to the fact that the reflection and transmission are very diffuse, it is generally difficult to accurately measure the reflectance and transmittance. To overcome these difficulties, we have carefully constructed an optical system including an integrating sphere and investigated variously colored nine kinds of scale. It is shown that the obtained spectra clearly characterize the optical differences among those structurally colored scales and also the differences between structural and pigmentary colors. Further, we have performed the angle-resolved measurement of the reflected light to characterize the spatial pattern of reflection, which is closely related to the mechanism of reflection.},

Despite their widespread adoption and utility, they suffer some disadvantages. Genetically encoded calcium sensors that can be expressed inside cells by transfection or transgenesis are desirable. The last 10 years have been marked by a rapid evolution in the laboratory of genetically encoded calcium sensors both figuratively and literally, resulting in 11 distinct configurations of fluorescent proteins and their attendant calcium sensor modules. Here, the design logic and performance of this abundant collection of sensors and their in vitro and in vivo use and performance are described. Genetically encoded calcium sensors have proved valuable in the measurement of calcium concentration in cellular organelles, for the most part in single cells in vitro. Their success as quantitative calcium sensors in tissues in vitro and in vivo is qualified, but they have proved valuable in imaging the pattern of calcium signals within tissues in whole animals. Some branches of the calcium sensor evolutionary tree continue to evolve rapidly and the steady progress in optimizing sensor parameters leads to the certain hope that these drawbacks will eventually be overcome by further genetic engineering.},

Resolution better than this is not attainable in compound eyes of realistic size.

abstract = {1. The fluorescent dye fluo-3, in its permeant acetoxymethyl form, was used to monitor calcium transients during twitch and tetanus of single fibres isolated from the anterior tibialis muscle of Rana temporaria (2-5°C). 2. Fluo-3 was loaded into the muscle fibre by diffusion. Under the experimental conditions used, approximately 45{\%} of maximal fluorescence was reached during a 1 s fused isometric tetanus. Fluo-3 had no detectable effect on the mechanical response of the fibre. 3. The free calcium concentration in the myoplasm, [Ca2+](i), and its variation with time, was calculated from the fluorescence signal by accounting for the on- and off-rate constants for the binding of calcium to the dye. The time course of the calcium transient during twitch and tetanus determined in this way agreed well with previous measurements based on fast-reacting calcium-sensitive dyes. 4. [Ca2+](i) declined steeply during the initial phase of force relaxation in both twitch and tetanus, but exhibited a secondary rise that closely coincided with the pseudoexponential fall of tension after the shoulder in the tetanus myogram. The rate of decay of [Ca2+](i) during relaxation and the rate of decline of force both became progressively reduced by repetitive stimulation. 5. Stretch and shortening ramps performed during the plateau of an isometric tetanus had no detectable effect upon the calcium transient during the movement. By contrast, shortening and stretch imposed during the linear phase of relaxation both led to an increase of [Ca2+](i) and to a steepening of the relaxation phase. 6. The results strongly suggest that the non-uniform length changes that are known to occur along a muscle fibre during relaxation enhance the release of calcium from the contractile system. The calcium mobilized in this way probably accounts for the transitory increase of [Ca2+](i) that is observed during the latter part of force relaxation.},

abstract = {Melanopsin has been proposed to be the photopigment of the intrinsically photosensitive retinal ganglion cells (ipRGCs); these photoreceptors of the mammalian eye drive circadian and pupillary adjustments through direct projections to the brain. Their action spectrum (lambda(max) approximately 480 nm) implicates an opsin and melanopsin is the only opsin known to exist in these cells. Melanopsin is required for ipRGC photosensitivity and for behavioural photoresponses that survive disrupted rod and cone function. Heterologously expressed melanopsin apparently binds retinaldehyde and mediates photic activation of G proteins. However, its amino-acid sequence differs from vertebrate photosensory opsins and some have suggested that melanopsin may be a photoisomerase, providing retinoid chromophore to an unidentified opsin. To determine whether melanopsin is a functional sensory photopigment, here we transiently expressed it in HEK293 cells that stably expressed TRPC3 channels. Light triggered a membrane depolarization in these cells and increased intracellular calcium. The light response resembled that of ipRGCs, with almost identical spectral sensitivity (lambda(max) approximately 479 nm). The phototransduction pathway included Gq or a related G protein, phospholipase C and TRPC3 channels. We conclude that mammalian melanopsin is a functional sensory photopigment, that it is the photopigment of ganglion-cell photoreceptors, and that these photoreceptors may use an invertebrate-like phototransduction cascade.},

abstract = {Recently a number of lower-affinity fluorescent Ca2+ indicators have become available with principal absorbance bands at visible wavelengths. This article evaluates these indicators, as well as two shorter wavelength indicators, mag-fura-5 and mag-indo-1, for their suitability as rapid Ca2+ indicators in frog skeletal muscle fibers. With three lower-affinity tricarboxylate indicators (mag-fura-5, mag-indo-1, and magnesium orange), the change in fluorescence in response to an action potential (delta F) appeared to track the myoplasmic Ca2+ transient (delta[Ca2+]) without delay. With three lower-affinity tetracarboxylate indicators (BTC, calcium-orange-5N, and calcium-green-5N) and one tricarboxylate indicator (magnesium green), delta F responded to delta[Ca2+] with a small delay. Unfortunately, with the tetracarboxylate indicators, other problems were detected that appear to limit their usefulness as reliable Ca2+ indicators. Surprisingly, delta F from mag-fura-red, another tricarboxylate indicator, was biphasic (with 480 nm excitation), a feature that also greatly limits its usefulness. With several of the indicators, estimates were obtained for the myoplasmic value of KD, Ca (the indicator's dissociation constant for Ca2+) and found to be elevated severalfold in comparison with the value measured in a simple salt solution. These and other problems related to the quantitative use of Ca2+ indicators in the intracellular environment are evaluated and discussed.},

abstract = {Ca(2+) sparks monitor transient local releases of Ca(2+) from the sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) into the myoplasm. The release takes place through ryanodine receptors (RYRs), the Ca(2+)-release channels of the SR. In intact fibers from frog skeletal muscle, the temporal and spatial properties of voltage-activated Ca(2+) sparks are well simulated by a model that assumes that the Ca(2+) flux underlying a spark is 2.5 pA (units of Ca(2+) current) for 4.6 ms (18 degrees C). This flux amplitude suggests that 1-5 active RYRs participate in the generation of a typical voltage-activated spark under physiological conditions. A major goal of future experiments is to estimate this number more precisely and, if it is two or more, to investigate the communication mechanism that allows multiple RYRs to be co-activated in a rapid but self-limited fashion.},

abstract = {A new group of fluorescent indicators with visible excitation and emission wavelengths has been synthesized for measurements of cytosolic free Ca2+. The five compounds, "rhod-1," "rhod-2," "fluo-1," "fluo-2," and "fluo-3" (Figs. 2 and 3), combine the 8-coordinate tetracarboxylate chelating site of 1,2-bis(2-amino-phenoxyethane-N,N,N',N'-tetraacetic acid with a xanthene chromophore to give a rhodamine-like or fluorescein-like fluorophore. Binding of Ca2+ increases the fluorescence by up to 40-fold. The Ca2+ dissociation constants are in the range 0.37-2.3 microM, so that the new indicators should give better resolution of high Ca2+ levels than previously obtainable with quin-2 or fura-2. The visible excitation wavelengths of the new compounds are more convenient for fluorescence microscopy and flow cytometry than the UV required by previous indicators. However, the new dyes' increase in fluorescence upon binding calcium is not accompanied by a wavelength shift, so they are unsuitable for measurements using ratios at two wavelengths. The most promising dye of this series is fluo-3, whose initial biological testing in fibroblasts is described in the following paper (Kao, J. P. Y., Harootunian, A. T., and Tsien, R. Y. (1989) J.

abstract = {Categorization of colour has been widely studied as a window into human language and cognition, and quite separately has been used pragmatically in image-database retrieval systems. This suggests the hypothesis that the best category system for pragmatic purposes coincides with human categories (i.e. the basic colours). We have tested this hypothesis by assessing the performance of different category systems in a machine-vision task. The task was the identification of the odd-one-out from triples of images obtained using a web-based image-search service. In each triple, two of the images had been retrieved using the same search term, the other a different term. The terms were simple concrete nouns. The results were as follows: (i) the odd-one-out task can be performed better than chance using colour alone; (ii) basic colour categorization performs better than random systems of categories; (iii) a category system that performs better than the basic colours could not be found; and (iv) it is not just the general layout of the basic colours that is important, but also the detail. We conclude that (i) the results support the plausibility of an explanation for the basic colours as a result of a pressure-to-optimality and (ii) the basic colours are good categories for machine vision image-retrieval systems.},

abstract = {Coloring in nature mostly comes from the inherent colors of materials, but it sometimes has a purely physical origin, such as diffraction or interference of light. The latter, called structural color or iridescence, has long been a problem of scientific interest. Recently, structural colors have attracted great interest because their applications have been rapidly progressing in many fields related to vision, such as the paint, automobile, cosmetics, and textile industries. As the research progresses, however, it has become clear that these colors are due to the presence of surprisingly minute microstructures, which are hardly attainable even by ultramodern nanotechnology. Fundamentally, most of the structural colors originate from basic optical processes represented by thin-film interference, multilayer interference, a diffraction grating effect, photonic crystals, light scattering, and so on. However, to enhance the perception of the eyes, natural creatures have produced various designs, in the course of evolution, to fulfill simultaneously high reflectivity in a specific wavelength range and the generation of diffusive light in a wide angular range. At a glance, these two characteristics seem to contradict each other in the usual optical sense, but these seemingly conflicting requirements are realized by combining appropriate amounts of regularity and irregularity of the structure. In this Review, we first explain the fundamental optical properties underlying the structural colors, and then survey these mysteries of nature from the viewpoint of regularity and irregularity of the structure. Finally, we propose a general principle of structural colors based on structural hierarchy and show their up-to-date applications.},

The study of these phenomena has informed an eclectic group of fields ranging, for example, from evolutionary processes in behavioural biology to micro-optical devices in technologically engineered systems. However, biological photonic systems are invariably structurally and often compositionally more elaborate than most synthetically fabricated photonic systems. For this reason, an appropriate gamut of physical methods and investigative techniques must be applied correctly so that the systems' photonic behaviour may be appropriately understood. Here, we survey a broad range of the most commonly implemented, successfully used and recently innovated physical methods. We discuss the costs and benefits of various spectrometric methods and instruments, namely scatterometers, microspectrophotometers, fibre-optic-connected photodiode array spectrometers and integrating spheres. We then discuss the role of the materials' refractive index and several of the more commonly used theoretical approaches. Finally, we describe the recent developments in the research field of photonic crystals and the implications for the further study of structural coloration in animals.},

abstract = {We developed a three-dimensional cylindrical diffusion-reaction model of a single amphibian myofibril in which Ca(2+) release occurred only at the Z-line. The model incorporated diffusion of Ca(2+), Mg(2+), and all relevant buffer species, as well as the kinetic binding reactions between the buffers and appropriate ions. Model data was blurred according to a Gaussian approximation of the point spread function of the microscope and directly compared with experimental data obtained using the confocal spot methodology. The flux parameters were adjusted until the simulated Z-line transient matched the experimental one. This model could not simultaneously predict key parameters of the experimental M- and Z-line transients, even when model parameters were adjusted to unreasonably extreme values. Even though the model was accurate in predicting the Z-line transient under conditions of high [EGTA], it predicted a significantly narrower Ca(2+) domain than observed experimentally. We modified the model to incorporate a broader band of release centered at the Z-line. This extended release model was superior both in simultaneously predicting critical features of the Z- and M-line transients as well as the domain profile under conditions of high [EGTA]. We conclude that a model of release occurring exclusively at the Z-line cannot explain our experimental data and suggest that Ca(2+) may be released from a broader region of the sarcoplasmic reticulum than just the T-tubule-sarcoplasmic reticulum junction.},

abstract = {The coloration of the common butterflies Aglais urticae (small tortoiseshell), Aglais io (peacock) and Vanessa atalanta (red admiral), belonging to the butterfly subfamily Nymphalinae, is due to the species-specific patterning of differently coloured scales on their wings. We investigated the scales' structural and pigmentary properties by applying scanning electron microscopy, (micro)spectrophotometry and imaging scatterometry. The anatomy of the wing scales appears to be basically identical, with an approximately flat lower lamina connected by trabeculae to a highly structured upper lamina, which consists of an array of longitudinal, parallel ridges and transversal crossribs. Isolated scales observed at the abwing (upper) side are blue, yellow, orange, red, brown or black, depending on their pigmentation. The yellow, orange and red scales contain various amounts of 3-OH-kynurenine and ommochrome pigment, black scales contain a high density of melanin, and blue scales have a minor amount of melanin pigment. Observing the scales from their adwing (lower) side always revealed a structural colour, which is blue in the case of blue, red and black scales, but orange for orange scales. The structural colours are created by the lower lamina, which acts as an optical thin film. Its reflectance spectrum, crucially determined by the lamina thickness, appears to be well tuned to the scales' pigmentary spectrum. The colours observed locally on the wing are also due to the degree of scale stacking. Thin films, tuned pigments and combinations of stacked scales together determine the wing coloration of nymphaline butterflies.},

abstract = {Bundles of intact fibres from soleus muscles of adult mice were isolated by dissection and one fibre within a bundle was micro-injected with either furaptra or mag-fluo-4, two low-affinity rapidly responding Ca(2+) indicators. Fibres were activated by action potentials to elicit changes in indicator fluorescence ($\Delta$F), a monitor of the myoplasmic free Ca(2+) transient ([Ca(2+)]), and changes in fibre tension. All injected fibres appeared to be slow-twitch (type I) fibres as inferred from the time course of their tension responses. The full-duration at half-maximum (FDHM) of $\Delta$F was found to be essentially identical with the two indicators; the mean value was 8.4 ± 0.3 ms (±SEM) at 16°C and 5.1 ± 0.3 ms at 22°C. The value at 22°C is about one-third that reported previously in enzyme-dissociated slow-twitch fibres that had been AM-loaded with mag-fluo-4: 12.4 ± 0.8 ms and 17.2 ± 1.7 ms. We attribute the larger FDHM in enzyme-dissociated fibres either to an alteration of fibre properties due to the enzyme treatment or to some error in the measurement of $\Delta$F associated with AM loading. $\Delta$F in intact fibres was simulated with a multi-compartment reaction-diffusion model that permitted estimation of the amount and time course of Ca(2+) release from the sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR), the binding and diffusion of Ca(2+) in the myoplasm, the re-uptake of Ca(2+) by the SR Ca(2+) pump, and $\Delta$[Ca(2+)] itself. In response to one action potential at 16°C, the following estimates were obtained: 107 $\mu$m for the amount of Ca(2+) release; 1.7 ms for the FDHM of the release flux; 7.6 $\mu$m and 4.9 ms for the peak and FDHM of spatially averaged $\Delta$[Ca(2+)]. With five action potentials at 67 Hz, the estimated amount of Ca(2+) release is 186 $\mu$m. Two important unknown model parameters are the on- and off-rate constants of the reaction between Ca(2+) and the regulatory sites on troponin; values of 0.4 × 10(8) m(-1) s(-1) and 26 s(-1), respectively, were found to be consistent with the $\Delta$F measurements.},

The wings of these insects are covered with a great number of two types of scales positioned like roof tiles. Type I scales are on the surface, while type II scales are situated below them. The structural color of the type I scales is recognized only on the dorsal side of both the fore and hind wings of the males of the aforementioned species. Both types of scales are responsible for pigment color of the wings, but iridescence is observed only in the type I scales. The brilliant structural color is due to a multilayer structure. The features of the scales, their dimensions and fine structure were obtained using scanning electron microscopy. Cross sections of the scales were then analyzed by transmission electron microscopy. The scales of the "normal" and clytie forms of A. ilia have a different nanostructure, but are of the same type. A similar type of structure, but with a different morphology, was also noticed in A. iris. The scales of the analyzed species resemble the scales of tropical Morpho butterflies.},

abstract = {Abstract Calcium (Ca2+) is a critical regulator of an immense array of biological processes, and the intracellular [Ca2+] that regulates these processes is {\~{}} 10,000 lower than the extracellular [Ca2+]. To study and understand these myriad Ca2+-dependent functions requires control and measurement of [Ca2+] in the nano- to micromolar range (where contaminating Ca2+ is a significant problem). As with pH, it is often essential to use Ca2+ buffers to control free [Ca2+] at the desired biologically relevant concentrations. Fortunately, there are numerous available Ca2+ buffers with different affinities that make this practical. However, there are numerous caveats with respect to making these solutions appropriately with known Ca2+ buffers. These include pH dependence, selectivity for Ca2+ (e.g., vs. Mg2+), ionic strength and temperature dependence, and complex multiple equilibria that occur in physiologically relevant solutions. Here we discuss some basic principles of Ca2+ buffering with respect to some of these caveats and provide practical tools (including freely downloadable computer programs) to help in the making and calibration of Ca2+-buffered solutions for a wide array of biological applications.},

Incorporation of the ethylenic linkage of the stilbene into a heterocyclic ring enhances the quantum efficiency and photochemical stability of the fluorophore. Compared to their widely used predecessor, "quin2", the new dyes offer up to 30-fold brighter fluorescence, major changes in wavelength not just intensity upon Ca2+ binding, slightly lower affinities for Ca2+, slightly longer wavelengths of excitation, and considerably improved selectivity for Ca2+ over other divalent cations. These properties, particularly the wavelength sensitivity to Ca2+, should make these dyes the preferred fluorescent indicators for many intracellular applications, especially in single cells, adherent cell layers, or bulk tissues.},

abstract = {The low-affinity fluorescent Ca(2+) indicators OGB-5N, Fluo-5N, fura-5N, Rhod-5N, and Mag-fluo-4 were evaluated for their ability to accurately track the kinetics of the spatially averaged free Ca(2+) transient (Delta[Ca(2+)]) in skeletal muscle. Frog single fibers were injected with one of the above indicators and, usually, furaptra (previously shown to rapidly track Delta[Ca(2+)]). In response to an action potential, the full duration at half-maximum of the indicator's fluorescence change (DeltaF) was found to be larger with OGB-5N, Fluo-5N, fura-5N, and Rhod-5N than with furaptra; thus, these indicators do not track Delta[Ca(2+)] with kinetic fidelity. In contrast, the DeltaF time course of Mag-fluo-4 was identical to furaptra's; thus, Mag-fluo-4 also yields reliable kinetic information about Delta[Ca(2+)]. Mag-fluo-4's DeltaF has a larger signal/noise ratio than furaptra's (for similar indicator concentrations), and should thus be more useful for tracking Delta[Ca(2+)] in small cell volumes. However, because the resting fluorescence of Mag-fluo-4 probably arises largely from indicator that is bound with Mg(2+), the amplitude of the Mag-fluo-4 signal, and its calibration in Delta[Ca(2+)] units, is likely to be more sensitive to variations in [Mg(2+)] than furaptra's.},

abstract = {We examined the correlation between color and structure of wing scales in the nymphalid butterflies Bicyclus anynana and Heliconius melpomene. All scales in B. anynana are rather similar in comparison to the clear structural differences of differently pigmented scales in H. melpomene. Where scale structural differences in H. melpomene are qualitative, they seem to be quantitative in B. anynana. There is a "gradient" in the density of some structural elements, the cross ribs, in the scales of B. anynana: black, gold, and brown scales show progressively lower cross rib density within an individual. There is, however, high individual variation in the absolute cross rib densities (i.e., scales with a particular color and cross rib density in one individual may have a different color but similar density in another individual). By ectopically inducing color pattern during early pupal development, we examined whether a scale's color and its microstructure could be uncoupled. The effect of these manipulations appears to be different in B. anynana and H. melpomene. In Bicyclus, "black" scales induced by wing damage at an ectopic location normally containing brown scales acquire both an intermediate structure and color between that of brown and normal black scales. In Heliconius, however, intermediate colors or scale structure were never observed, and scales with an altered color (due to damage) always have the same structure as normal scales with that color. The results are discussed on the basis of gene expression patterns, variability in rates of scale development and pigment, and scale sclerotization pathways.},

Because of optical phenomena, changes in the angle of incidence of light and the viewing angle of an observer result in shifts in the color of butterfly wings. Colors ranging from green to purple, which are due to nonplanar specular reflection, can be observed on Papilio blumei iridescent scales. This refers to a phenomenon in which the curved surface patterns in the thin-film structure cause the specular component of the reflected light to be directed at various angles while affecting the spectral reflectivity at the same time by changing the optical path length through the structure. We determined the spectral reflectivities of P. blumei iridescent scales numerically by using models of a butterfly scale microstructure and experimentally by using a microscale-reflectance spectrometer. The numerical models accurately predict the shifts in spectral reflectivity observed experimentally.},

abstract = {Ca(2+) release from the sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) of skeletal muscle takes place at the triadic junctions; following release, Ca(2+) spreads within the sarcomere by diffusion. Here, we report multicompartment simulations of changes in sarcomeric Ca(2+) evoked by action potentials (APs) in fast-twitch fibers of adult mice. The simulations include Ca(2+) complexation reactions with ATP, troponin, parvalbumin, and the SR Ca(2+) pump, as well as Ca(2+) transport by the pump. Results are compared with spatially averaged Ca(2+) transients measured in mouse fibers with furaptra, a low-affinity, rapidly responding Ca(2+) indicator. The furaptra Deltaf(CaD) signal (change in the fraction of the indicator in the Ca(2+)-bound form) evoked by one AP is well simulated under the assumption that SR Ca(2+) release has a peak of 200-225 microM/ms and a FDHM of approximately 1.6 ms (16 degrees C). Deltaf(CaD) elicited by a five-shock, 67-Hz train of APs is well simulated under the assumption that in response to APs 2-5, Ca(2+) release decreases progressively from 0.25 to 0.15 times that elicited by the first AP, a reduction likely due to Ca(2+) inactivation of Ca(2+) release. Recovery from inactivation was studied with a two-AP protocol; the amplitude of the second release recovered to {\textgreater}0.9 times that of the first with a rate constant of 7 s(-1). An obvious feature of Deltaf(CaD) during a five-shock train is a progressive decline in the rate of decay from the individual peaks of Deltaf(CaD). According to the simulations, this decline is due to a reduction in available Ca(2+) binding sites on troponin and parvalbumin. The effects of sarcomere length, the location of the triadic junctions, resting [Ca(2+)], the parvalbumin concentration, and possible uptake of Ca(2+) by mitochondria were also investigated. Overall, the simulations indicate that this reaction-diffusion model, which was originally developed for Ca(2+) sparks in frog fibers, works well when adapted to mouse fast-twitch fibers stimulated by APs.},

abstract = {The gastric glands of the mammalian fundic mucosa are constituted by different cell types. Gastric fluid is a mixture of acid, alkali, ions, enzymes, and mucins secreted by parietal, chief, and mucous cells. We studied activation of acid secretion using LysoSensor Yellow/Blue in conjunction with fluo 3 to measure changes in pH and Ca(2+) in isolated rabbit gastric glands. We evidenced a spatial heterogeneity in the amplitude of acid response along the gland axis under histamine and cholinergic stimulation. Carbachol induced a transitory pH increase before acidification. This relative alkalinization may be related to granule release from other cell types. Omeprazole inhibited the acid component but not the rise in pH. Histamine stimulated acid secretion without increase of lumen pH. We studied the relationship between Ca(2+) release and/or entry and H(+) secretion in glands stimulated by carbachol. Ca(2+) release was associated with a fast and transient components of H(+) secretion. We found a linear relationship between Ca(2+) release and H(+) secretion. Ca(2+) entry was associated with a second slow and larger component of acid secretion. The fast component may be the result of activation of Cl(-) and K(+) channels and hence H(+)/K(+) pumps already present in the membrane, whereas the slow component might be associated with translocation of H(+)/K(+) pumps to the canaliculi. In conclusion, with cholinergic stimulation, gastric glands secrete a mixture of acid and other product(s) with a pH above 4.2, both triggered by Ca(2+) release. Maintenance of acid secretion depends on Ca(2+) entry and perhaps membrane fusion.},

abstract = {The natural world consists of hierarchical levels of complexity that range from subatomic particles and molecules to ecosystems and beyond. This implies that, in order to explain the features and behavior of a whole system, a theory might be required that would operate at the corresponding hierarchical level, i.e. where self-organization processes take place. In the past, biological research has focused on questions that could be answered by a reductionist program of genetics. The organism (and its development) was considered an epiphenomenona of its genes. However, a profound rethinking of the biological paradigm is now underway and it is likely that such a process will lead to a conceptual revolution emerging from the ashes of reductionism. This revolution implies the search for general principles on which a cogent theory of biology might rely. Because much of the logic of living systems is located at higher levels, it is imperative to focus on them. Indeed, both evolution and physiology work on these levels. Thus, by no means Systems Biology could be considered a 'simple' 'gradual' extension of Molecular Biology.},

A few representative cases are presented: the satyrine Bicyclus anynana, the heliconian Heliconius melpomene, the small white Pieris rapae and the small copper Lycaena phlaeas. The colour of the eye shine is determined mainly by the reflectance spectrum of the tapetal mirror and the transmittance spectrum of the photoreceptor screening pigments, if present near the light-guiding rhabdom. Reflectance spectra measured from individual ommatidia show that tapetum and screening pigments are co-expressed in fixed combinations, thus determining different ommatidial classes. The classes are distributed in an irregular pattern that can be rapidly assessed with the novel epi-illumination apparatus. Many butterfly species appear to have red-reflecting ommatidia, which is interpreted to indicate the presence of red-sensitive photoreceptors.},

abstract = {The spatiotemporal characteristics of the Ca(2+) release process in mouse skeletal muscle were investigated in enzymatically dissociated fibers from flexor digitorum brevis (FDB) muscles, using a custom-made two-photon microscope with laser scanning imaging (TPLSM) and spot detection capabilities. A two-microelectrode configuration was used to electrically stimulate the muscle fibers, to record action potentials (APs), and to control their myoplasmic composition. We used 125 muM of the low-affinity Ca(2+) indicator Oregon green 488 BAPTA-5N (OGB-5N), and 5 or 10 mM of the Ca(2+) chelator EGTA (pCa 7) in order to arrest fiber contraction and to constrain changes in the [Ca(2+)] close to the release sites. Image and spot data showed that the resting distribution of OGB-5N fluorescence was homogeneous along the fiber, except for narrow peaks ( approximately 23{\%} above the bulk fluorescence) centered at the Z-lines, as evidenced by their nonoverlapping localization with respect to di-8-ANEPPS staining of the transverse tubules (T-tubules). Using spot detection, localized Ca(2+) transients evoked by AP stimulation were recorded from adjacent longitudinal positions 100 nm apart. The largest and fastest DeltaF/F transients were detected at sites flanking the Z-lines and colocalized with T-tubules; the smallest and slowest were detected at the M-line, whereas transients at the Z-line showed intermediate features. Three-dimensional reconstructions demonstrate the creation of two AP-evoked Ca(2+) release domains per sarcomere, which flank the Z-line and colocalize with T-tubules. In the presence of 10 mM intracellular EGTA, these domains are formed in approximately 1.4 ms and dissipate within approximately 4 ms, after the peak of the AP. Their full-width at half-maximum (FWHM), measured at the time that Ca(2+) transients peaked at T-tubule locations, was 0.62 mum, similar to the 0.61 mum measured for di-8-ANEPPS profiles. Both these values exceed the limit of resolution of the optical system, but their similarity suggests that at high [EGTA] the Ca(2+) domains in adult mammalian muscle fibers are confined to Ca(2+) release sites located at the junctional sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR).},

Using a simple model, we have shown that the combined action of interference and diffraction is essential for the structural color. It is also shown that the presence of pigment beneath the iridescent scales greatly enhances the blue coloring by reducing the unwanted background light.

abstract = {The fluorescent Ca2+ indicator dye—quin2—is the basis of one of the most popular methods for measuring cytosolic free Ca2+ [(Ca2+]i], especially in suspensions of mammalian cells. Quin2 has several advantages over other methods for measuring cytosolic free Ca2+: (1) it can be loaded into the cytosol of millions of cells simultaneously without any micromanipulations or any disruption of the plasma membrane, (2) it is monitored with a conventional cuvette spectrofluorimeter, (3) its readings are usually easily calibrated at typical resting levels of [Ca2+]i (∼10−7M) and below (to 10−8M), whereas all other techniques do their best at detecting activated levels (∼10−6M) and are nearly at their detection limits at resting levels, and (4) it avoids many of the drawbacks particular to other [Ca2+]i measurement techniques. The chapter compares quin2 with newer fluorescent indicators—fura-2 and indo-1—as they are much brighter in fluorescence than quin2. Because fura-2 and indo-1 are sensitive enough to give large calibratable signals from single cells or regions of cells, they allow a direct measurement of compartmentalization and heterogeneity.},

Transmission and scanning electron microscopy revealed that the white scales are classically structured: the upper lamina, with prominent ridges and large open windows, is well separated by trabeculae from a flat, continuous lower lamina. In the glass scales, the upper lamina, with inconspicuous ridges and windows, is almost flat and closely apposed to the equally flat lower lamina. The glass scales thus approximate ideal thin films, in agreement with the observation that they reflect light directionally and are iridescent. Reflectance and transmittance spectra measured from the glass scales with a microspectrophotometer agree with spectra calculated for an ideal non-absorbing thin film. Imaging scatterometry of single, isolated glass scales demonstrated that the reflected light can be strongly polarized, indicating that they function as polarizing reflectors.},

@article{Kemp2007,
abstract = {Structural colors result from an interaction between light and the fine-scale physical structure of a surface, and are often extremely bright, chromatic, and iridescent. Given that these visual features depend upon the aggregate abundance and architectural precision of photonic structures, structurally colored sexual ornaments seem well placed to indicate a range of mate quality characteristics. We tested this hypothesis by investigating the signaling potential of structural coloration in the sexually dimorphic butterfly Colias eurytheme. Males of this species display iridescent ultraviolet (UV) markings (arising from multilayer thin films) that overlay a broad area of yellowish-orange pigmentation on their dorsal wing surface. Only the structural UV has demonstrated function as a sexual signal; hence we predicted that it should contain more reliable phenotypic and/or genetic quality information, which would be indicated by phenotypic and/or genetically mediated condition dependence. In two split-family breeding experiments we manipulated condition by exposing full siblings to different stressors at two different juvenile life-history stages: (1) reduced larval host-plant quality and (2) transient heat/cold shocks during metamorphosis. Both stressors had profound effects on key developmental and life-history traits. Each stressor also significantly affected male dorsal coloration; thus, the expression of both structural and pigmentary coloration is phenotypically condition dependent. As predicted, the strongest condition dependence was evident in the brightness and angular visibility (i.e., iridescence) of the UV. Characteristics of both the iridescent UV and pigmentary orange also exhibited moderate-high and significant heritability (H(2) approximately h(2) approximately 0.4-0.9). However, genetic and residual variances did not increase under stress; thus, the observed condition dependence was not genetically mediated as predicted if wing color trait signals "good" genes for the ability to either withstand or circumvent developmental stress. The heightened stress sensitivity of the iridescent UV suggests that it offers an informative lifetime indicator of juvenile environments and, henceforth, adult male phenotypic condition, which may be salient to females seeking a highly fertile and/or nutritious male ejaculate.},

The review primarily considers the methods that have been developed for electrophysiological determinations of criterion amplitudes of slow-wave responses from single retinal cells. Traditional flash methods can require tedious dark adaptations and may yield erroneous spectral sensitivity curves which are not seen in such modifications as ramp methods. Linear response methods involve interferometry, while constant response methods involve manual or automatic adjustments of continuous illumination to keep response amplitudes constant during spectral scans. In DC or AC computerized constant response methods, feedback to determine intensities at each wavelength is derived from the response amplitudes themselves. Although all but traditional flash methods have greater or lesser abilities to provide on-line determinations of spectral sensitivities, computerized constant response methods are the most satisfactory due to flexibility, speed and maintenance of a constant adaptation level.},

abstract = {We have modeled the time-course of Ca2" binding to calmodulin, troponin, parvalbumin, and myosin in response to trains of transient increases in the free myoplasmic calcium ion concentration (pCa). A simple mathematical expression was used to describe each pCa transient, the shape and duration of which is qualitatively similar to those thought to occur in vivo. These calculations assumed that all the individual metal binding sites are noninteracting and that Ca2" and Mg2" bind competitively to the Ca2"-Mg2+ sites of troponin, parvalbumin, and myosin. All the on-and-off rate constants for both Ca2' and Mg2+ were obtained either from the literature or from our own research. The percent saturation of the Ca2+-Mg2+ sites with Ca2+ was found to change very little in response to each pCa transient in the presence of 2.5 x 10-3M Mg2+. Our analysis suggests that the Ca2+ content of these sites is a measure of the intensity and frequency of recent muscle activity because large changes in the Ca2" occupancy of these sites can occur with repeated stimulation. In contrast, large rapid changes in the amount of Ca2' bound to the Ca2+-specific sites of troponin and calmodulin are induced by each pCa transient. Thus, only sites of the "Ca2+-specific" type can act as rapid Ca2+-regulatory sites in muscle. Fluctuation in the total amount of Ca2+ bound to these sites in response to various types of pCa transients further suggests that in vivo only about one-half to one-third of the total steady-state myofibrillar Ca2+-binding capacity exchanges Ca2+ during any single transient.},

abstract = {The full primary structure of a long-wavelength absorbing visual pigment of the small white butterfly, Pieris rapae crucivora, was determined by molecular cloning. In situ hybridization of the opsin mRNA of the novel visual pigment (PrL) demonstrated that it is expressed in the two distal photoreceptor cells (R3 and R4) as well as in the proximal photoreceptors (R5-8) in all three types of ommatidia of the Pieris eye. The main, long-wavelength band of the spectral sensitivities of the R3 and R4 photoreceptors is well described by the absorption spectrum of a visual pigment with absorption maximum at 563 nm; i.e. PrL is a visual pigment R563. The spectral sensitivities of R5-8 photoreceptors in ommatidial type I and III peak at 620 nm and those in type II ommatidia peak at 640 nm. The large shifts of the spectral sensitivities of the R5-8 photoreceptors with respect to the absorption spectrum of their visual pigment can be explained with the spectral filtering by pale-red (PR) and deep-red (DR) screening pigments that are concentrated in clusters of granules near the rhabdom boundary. The peak absorbance of the two spectral filters appears to be approximately 1 (PR) and 2 (DR).},

Diffusion of free dye (D), calcium dye (CaD), and Ca(2+) were included in the model. The Ca(2+) release current was assumed to last 8 ms, to arise within 4 x 10(-5) microm(3) at the triad and to be constant during release. Line scan confocal fluorescence images of Ca(2+) sparks were simulated by 3D convolution of the calculated distribution of CaD with a Gaussian kernel approximating the point spread function of the microscope. Our results indicate that the amplitude of the simulated spark is proportional to the Ca(2+) release current if all other model parameters are constant. For a given release current, the kinetic properties and concentrations of the binding sites and the diffusion parameters of D, CaD, and Ca(2+) all have significant effects on the simulated Ca(2+) sparks.

Our present study challenges this assumption, demonstrating that in addition to the requirement of absorbing pigmentation, complex nano-structures contribute to the low reflectance of certain natural surfaces. We describe preliminary findings of an investigation into the nature of the black regions observed on the dorsal wings of several Lepidoptera. Specifically, we quantify the optical absorption associated with black wing regions on the butterfly Papilio ulysses and find that the nanostructure of the wing scales of these regions contributes significantly to their black appearance.},

abstract = {Electrically elicited Ca2+ transients reported with the fast Ca2+ dye MagFluo-4 AM and myosin heavy chain (MHC) electrophoretic patterns were obtained in intact, enzymatically dissociated fibres from adult mice extensor digitorum longus (EDL) and soleus muscles. Thirty nine fibres (23 from soleus and 16 from EDL) were analysed by both fluorescence microscopy and electrophoresis. These fibres were grouped as follows: group 1 included 13 type I and 4 type IC fibres; group 2 included 2 type IIC, 3 IIA and 1 I/IIA/IIX fibres; group 3 included 4 type IIX and 1 type IIX/IIB fibres; group 4 included 2 type IIB/IIX and 9 type IIB fibres. Ca2+ transients obtained in groups 1, 2, 3 and 4 had the following kinetic parameters (mean ± s.e.m.): amplitude ($\Delta$. F/. F): 0.61 ± 0.05, 0.53 ± 0.08, 0.61 ± 0.06 and 0.61 ± 0.03; rise time (ms): 1.64 ± 0.05, 1.35 ± 0.05, 1.18 ± 0.06 and 1.14 ± 0.04; half-amplitude width (ms): 19.12 ± 1.85, 11.86 ± 3.03, 4.62 ± 0.31 and 4.23 ± 0.37; and time constants of decay ($\tau$1 and $\tau$2, ms): 3.33 ± 0.13 and 52.48 ± 3.93, 2.69 ± 0.22 and 41.06 ± 9.13, 1.74 ± 0.06 and 12.88 ± 1.93, and 1.56 ± 0.11 and 9.45 ± 1.03, respectively. The statistical differences between the four groups and the analysis of the distribution of the parameters of Ca2+ release and clearance show that there is a continuum from slow to fast, that parallels the MHC continuum from pure type I to pure IIB. However, type IIA fibres behave more like IIX and IIB fibres regarding Ca2+ release but closer to type I fibres regarding Ca2+ clearance. In conclusion, we show for the first time the diversity of Ca2+ transients for the whole continuum of fibre types and correlate this functional diversity with the structural and biochemical diversity of the skeletal muscle fibres. {\textcopyright} 2010 The Authors.

@article{Melzer1987,
abstract = {A general procedure for using myoplasmic calcium transients measured with a metallochromic indicator dye to calculate the time course of calcium release from the sarcoplasmic reticulum in voltage-clamped skeletal muscle fibers is described and analyzed. Explicit properties are first assigned to all relatively rapidly equilibrating calcium binding sites in the myoplasm so that the calcium content (CaF) in this pool of "fast" calcium can be calculated from the calcium transient. The overall properties of the transport systems and relatively slowly equilibrating binding sites that remove calcium from CaF are then characterized experimentally from the decay of CaF following fiber repolarization. The rate of calcium release can then be calculated as dCaF/dt plus the rate of removal of calcium from CaF. Two alternatives are assumed for the component of CaF that is due to fast binding sites intrinsic to the fiber: (a) a linear instantaneous buffer or (b) a set of binding sites having properties similar to thin filament troponin. Both assumptions yielded similar calcium release wave forms. Three alternative methods for characterizing the removal system are presented. The choice among these or other methods for characterizing removal can be based entirely on convenience since any method that reproduces the decay of CaF following fiber repolarization will give the same release wave form. The calculated release wave form will be accurate provided that the properties assumed for CaF are correct, that release turns off within a relatively short time after fiber repolarization, that the properties of the slow removal system are the same during and after fiber depolarization, and that possible spatial nonuniformities of free or bound calcium do not introduce major errors.},

abstract = {Few mechanisms exist in nature that effect colour reflectivity, simultaneously high in spectral purity and in intensity, over a strictly limited portion of solid angle above a surface. Fewer still bring about such colour reflectivity with an angle dependence that is distinct from the colour transition associated with conventional multilayer interference. We have discovered that the ventral wings of the butterfly Ancyluris meliboeus exhibit these optical effects, and that they result from remarkable nano-scale architecture on the wing scales of the butterfly. This nano-structure is in the form of high-tilt multilayering that, as a result of abrupt termination of the multilayers, brings about diffraction concurrently with interference. The product is bright structural colour in a limited angular region over the ventral wing surface that enables remarkably strong flicker and colour contrast through minimal wing movement. The visibility effects associated with its colour, in terms of bright and dark zones of the observation hemisphere over the wing surface, are described. We suggest the purpose of the high-contrast ventral wing visibility associated with A. meliboeus is at-rest signalling; this is distinct from the dorsal wing visibility of other species such as those of the genus Morpho, the function of which is largely for in-flight signalling.},

abstract = {During excitation-contraction coupling in skeletal muscle, calcium ions are released into the myoplasm by the sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) in response to depolarization of the fibre's exterior membranes. Ca(2+) then diffuses to the thin filaments, where Ca(2+) binds to the Ca(2+) regulatory sites on troponin to activate muscle contraction. Quantitative studies of these events in intact muscle preparations have relied heavily on Ca(2+)-indicator dyes to measure the change in the spatially-averaged myoplasmic free Ca(2+) concentration ($\Delta$[Ca(2+)]) that results from the release of SR Ca(2+). In normal fibres stimulated by an action potential, $\Delta$[Ca(2+)] is large and brief, requiring that an accurate measurement of $\Delta$[Ca(2+)] be made with a low-affinity rapidly-responding indicator. Some low-affinity Ca(2+) indicators monitor $\Delta$[Ca(2+)] much more accurately than others, however, as reviewed here in measurements in frog twitch fibres with sixteen low-affinity indicators. This article also examines measurements and simulations of $\Delta$[Ca(2+)] in mouse fast-twitch fibres. The simulations use a multi-compartment model of the sarcomere that takes into account Ca(2+)'s release from the SR, its diffusion and binding within the myoplasm, and its re-sequestration by the SR Ca(2+) pump. The simulations are quantitatively consistent with the measurements and appear to provide a satisfactory picture of the underlying Ca(2+) movements.},

abstract = {We propose a semi-infinite 1-D photonic crystal approach for designing artificial reflectors which aim to reproduce color changes with the angle of incidence found in biological periodic multilayer templates. We show that both the dominant reflected wavelength and the photonic bandgap can be predicted and that these predictions agree with exact calculations of reflectance spectra for a finite multilayer structure. In order to help the designer, the concept of spectral richness of angle-tuned color-selecting reflectors is introduced and color changes with angle are displayed in a chromaticity diagram. The usefulness of the photonic crystal approach is demonstrated by modelling a biological template (found in the cuticle of Chrysochora vittata beetle) and by designing a bio-inspired artificial reflector which reproduces the visual aspect of the template. The bioinspired novel aspect of the design relies on the strong unbalance between the thicknesses of the two layers forming the unit cell.},

abstract = {We investigate the mechanical properties of proposed graphene-like hexagonal gallium nitride monolayer (g-GaN) using first-principles calculations based on densityfunctional theory. Compared to the graphene-like hexagonal boron nitride monolayer (g-BN), g-GaN is softer, with 40 {\%} in-plane stiffness, 50 {\%}, 46 {\%}, and 42 {\%} ultimate strengths in armchair, zigzag, and biaxial strains, respectively. However, g-GaN has a larger Poisson's ratio, 0.43, about 1.9 times that of g-BN. It was found that the g-GaN also sustains much smaller strains before rupture. We obtained the second-, third-, fourth-, and fifth-order elastic constants for a rigorous continuum description of the elastic response of g-GaN. The second-order elastic constants, including inplane stiffness, are predicted to monotonically increase with pressure while the Poisson's ratio monotonically decreases with increasing pressure. The sound velocity of a compressional wave has a minima of 10 km/s at an in-plane pressure of 1 N/m, while as a shear wave's velocity monotonically increases with pressure. The tunable sound velocities have promising applications in nano waveguides and surface acoustic wave sensors. {\textcopyright} 2013 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.},

abstract = {Van der Waals (vdW) heterostructures consisting of graphene and other two-dimensional materials provide good opportunities for achieving desired electronic and optoelectronic properties. Here, we focus on vdW heterostructures composed of graphene and gallium nitride (GaN). Using density functional theory, we perform a systematic study on the structural and electronic properties of heterostructures consisting of graphene and GaN. Small band gaps are opened up at or near the $\Gamma$ point of the Brillouin zone for all of the heterostructures. We also investigate the effect of the stacking sequence and electric fields on their electronic properties. Our results show that the tunability of the band gap is sensitive to the stacking sequence in bilayer-graphene-based heterostructures. In particular, in the case of graphene/graphene/GaN, a band gap of up to 334 meV is obtained under a perpendicular electric field. The band gap of bilayer graphene between GaN sheets (GaN/graphene/graphene/GaN) shows similar tunability, and increases to 217 meV with the perpendicular electric field reaching 0.8 V Å − 1.},

abstract = {The ability to generate, visualize, and analyze motions of biomolecules has made a significant impact upon modern biology. Molecular Dynamics has gained substantial use, but remains computationally demanding and difficult to setup for many biologists. Elastic network models (ENMs) are an alternative and have been shown to generate the dominant equilibrium motions of biomolecules quickly and efficiently. These dominant motions have been shown to be functionally relevant and also to indicate the likely direction of conformational changes. Most structures have a small number of dominant motions. Comparing computed motions to the structure's conformational ensemble derived from a collection of static structures or frames from an MD trajectory is an important way to understand functional motions as well as evaluate the models. Modes of motion computed from ENMs can be visualized to gain functional and mechanistic understanding and to compute useful quantities such as average positional fluctuations, internal distance changes, collectiveness of motions, and directional correlations within the structure.},

If overall translation and rotation are eliminated, the two spaces can be constructed by a simple linear transformation in Cartesian coordinate space, which remains valid over several hundred picoseconds. The transformation follows from the covariance matrix of the positional deviations. The essential degrees of freedom seem to describe motions which are relevant for the function of the protein, while the physically constrained subspace merely describes irrelevant local fluctuations. The near-constraint behavior of the latter subspace allows the separation of equations of motion and promises the possibility of investigating independently the essential space and performing dynamic simulations only in this reduced space.},

abstract = {Glucose is a major metabolic substrate required for cancer cell survival and growth. It is mainly imported into cells by facilitated glucose transporters (GLUTs). Here we demonstrate the importance of another glucose import system, the sodium-dependent glucose transporters (SGLTs), in pancreatic and prostate adenocarcinomas, and investigate their role in cancer cell survival. Three experimental approaches were used: (i) immunohistochemical mapping of SGLT1 and SGLT2 distribution in tumors; (ii) measurement of glucose uptake in fresh isolated tumors using an SGLT-specific radioactive glucose analog, $\alpha$-methyl-4-deoxy-4-[(18)F]fluoro-D-glucopyranoside (Me4FDG), which is not transported by GLUTs; and (iii) measurement of in vivo SGLT activity in mouse models of pancreatic and prostate cancer using Me4FDG-PET imaging. We found that SGLT2 is functionally expressed in pancreatic and prostate adenocarcinomas, and provide evidence that SGLT2 inhibitors block glucose uptake and reduce tumor growth and survival in a xenograft model of pancreatic cancer. We suggest that Me4FDG-PET imaging may be used to diagnose and stage pancreatic and prostate cancers, and that SGLT2 inhibitors, currently in use for treating diabetes, may be useful for cancer therapy.},

abstract = {The crystal structure of Na+-coupled galactose symporter (vSGLT) reports the transporter in its substrate-bound state, with a Na+ ion modeled in a binding site corresponding to that of a homologous protein, leucine transporter (LeuT). In repeated molecular dynamics simulations, however, we find the Na+ ion instable, invariably and spontaneously diffusing out of the transporter through a pathway lined by D189, which appears to facilitate the diffusion of the ion toward the cytoplasm. Further analysis of the trajectories and close structural examination, in particular, comparison of the Na+-binding sites of vSGLT and LeuT, strongly indicates that the crystal structure of vSGLT actually represents an ion-releasing state of the transporter. The observed dynamics of the Na+ ion, in contrast to the substrate, also suggests that the cytoplasmic release of the Na+ ion precedes that of the substrate, thus shedding light on a key step in the transport cycle of this secondary transporter. {\textcopyright} 2009 by the Biophysical Society.},

abstract = {Sodium-Galactose Transporter (SGLT) is a secondary active symporter which accumulates sugars into cells by using the electrochemical gradient of Na+ across the membrane. Previous computational studies provided insights into the release process of the two ligands (galactose and sodium ion) into the cytoplasm from the inward-facing conformation of Vibrio parahaemolyticus sodium/galactose transporter (vSGLT). Several aspects of the transport mechanism of this symporter remain to be clarified: (i) a detailed kinetic and thermodynamic characterization of the exit path of the two ligands is still lacking; (ii) contradictory conclusions have been drawn concerning the gating role of Y263; (iii) the role of Na+ in modulating the release path of galactose is not clear. In this work, we use bias-exchange metadynamics simulations to characterize the free energy profile of the galactose and Na+ release processes toward the intracellular side. Surprisingly, we find that the exit of Na+ and galactose is non-concerted as the cooperativity between the two ligands is associated to a transition that is not rate limiting. The dissociation barriers are of the order of 11-12 kcal/mol for both the ion and the substrate, in line with kinetic information concerning this type of transporters. On the basis of these results we propose a branched six-state alternating access mechanism, which may be shared also by other members of the LeuT-fold transporters.},

abstract = {The Na(+)/galactose cotransporter (vSGLT) of Vibrio parahaemolyticus, tagged with C-terminal hexahistidine, has been purified to apparent homogeneity by Ni(2+) affinity chromatography and gel filtration. Resequencing the vSGLT gene identified an important correction: the N terminus constitutes an additional 13 functionally essential residues. The mass of His-tagged vSGLT expressed under its native promoter, as determined by electrospray ionization-mass spectrometry (ESI-MS), verifies these 13 residues in wild-type vSGLT. A fusion protein of vSGLT and green fluorescent protein, comprising a mass of over 90 kDa, was also successfully analyzed by ESI-MS. Reconstitution of purified vSGLT yields proteoliposomes active in Na(+)-dependent galactose uptake, with sugar preferences (galactose {\textgreater} glucose {\textgreater} fucose) reflecting those of wild-type vSGLT in vivo. Substrates are transported with apparent 1:1 stoichiometry and apparent K(m) values of 129 mm (Na(+)) and 158 microm (galactose). Freeze-fracture electron microscopy of functional proteoliposomes shows intramembrane particles of a size consistent with vSGLT existing as a monomer. We conclude that vSGLT is a suitable model for the study of sugar cotransporter mechanisms and structure, with potential applicability to the larger SGLT family of important sodium:solute cotransporters. It is further demonstrated that ESI-MS is a powerful tool for the study of proteomics of membrane transporters.},

abstract = {Secondary active transporters, such as those that adopt the leucine-transporter fold, are found in all domains of life, and they have the unique capability of harnessing the energy stored in ion gradients to accumulate small molecules essential for life as well as expel toxic and harmful compounds. How these proteins couple ion binding and transport to the concomitant flow of substrates is a fundamental structural and biophysical question that is beginning to be answered at the atomistic level with the advent of high-resolution structures of transporters in different structural states. Nonetheless, the dynamic character of the transporters, such as ion/substrate binding order and how binding triggers conformational change, is not revealed from static structures, yet it is critical to understanding their function. Here, we report a series of molecular simulations carried out on the sugar transporter vSGLT that lend insight into how substrate and ions are released from the inward-facing state of the transporter. Our simulations reveal that the order of release is stochastic. Functional experiments were designed to test this prediction on the human homolog, hSGLT1, and we also found that cytoplasmic release is not ordered, but we confirmed that substrate and ion binding from the extracellular space is ordered. Our findings unify conflicting published results concerning cytoplasmic release of ions and substrate and hint at the possibility that other transporters in the superfamily may lack coordination between ions and substrate in the inward-facing state.},

abstract = {The sodium/iodide symporter (NIS or SLC5A5) is an intrinsic membrane protein implicated in iodide uptake into thyroid follicular cells. It plays a crucial role in iodine metabolism and thyroid regulation and its function is widely exploited in the diagnosis and treatment of benign and malignant thyroid diseases. A great effort is currently being made to develop a NIS-based gene therapy also allowing the radiotreatment of nonthyroidal tumors. NIS is also expressed in other tissues, such as salivary gland, stomach and mammary gland during lactation, where its physiological role remains unclear. The molecular identity of the thyroid iodide transporter was elucidated approximately fifteen years ago. It belongs to the superfamily of sodium/solute symporters, SSS (and to the human transporter family, SLC5), and is composed of 13 transmembrane helices and 643 amino acid residues in humans. Knowledge concerning NIS structure/function relationship has been obtained by taking advantage of the high resolution structure of one member of the SSS family, the Vibrio parahaemolyticus sodium/galactose symporter (vSGLT), and from studies of gene mutations leading to congenital iodine transport defects (ITD). This review will summarize current knowledge regarding the molecular characterization of NIS. ?? 2013 Elsevier B.V.},

@article{Erokhova2016,
abstract = {The small intestine is void of aquaporins adept at facilitating vectorial water transport and yet it reabsorbs about eight liters of fluid daily. Implications of the sodium glucose cotransporter SGLT1 in either pumping water or passively channeling water, contrast with its reported water transporting capacity, which lags behind that of aquaporin-1 by three orders of magnitude. Here we overexpressed SGLT1 in MDCK cell monolayers and reconstituted the purified transporter into proteoliposomes. We observed the rate of osmotic proteoliposome deflation by light scattering. Fluorescence correlation spectroscopy served to assess (i) SGLT1 abundance in both vesicles and plasma membranes and (ii) flow-mediated dilution of an aqueous dye adjacent to the cell monolayer. Calculation of the unitary water channel permeability, pf, yielded similar values for cell and proteoliposome experiments. Neither the absence of glucose or Na+, nor the lack of membrane voltage in vesicles, nor the directionality of water flow grossly altered pf. Such weak dependence on protein conformation indicates that a water-impermeable occluded state (glucose and Na+ in their binding pockets) lasts for only a minor fraction of the transport cycle or, alternatively, that occlusion of the substrate does not render the transporter water-impermeable as was suggested by computational studies of the bacterial homologue vSGLT. While the similarity between the pf values of SGLT1 and aquaporin-1 makes a transcellular pathway plausible, it renders water pumping physiologically negligible as the passive flux would be orders of magnitude larger.},

abstract = {Membrane transporters that use energy stored in sodium gradients to drive nutrients into cells constitute a major class of proteins. We report the crystal structure of a member of the solute sodium symporters (SSS), the Vibrio parahaemolyticus sodium/galactose symporter (vSGLT). The approximately 3.0 angstrom structure contains 14 transmembrane (TM) helices in an inward-facing conformation with a core structure of inverted repeats of 5 TM helices (TM2 to TM6 and TM7 to TM11). Galactose is bound in the center of the core, occluded from the outside solutions by hydrophobic residues. Surprisingly, the architecture of the core is similar to that of the leucine transporter (LeuT) from a different gene family. Modeling the outward-facing conformation based on the LeuT structure, in conjunction with biophysical data, provides insight into structural rearrangements for active transport.},

abstract = {Normal mode analysis (NMA) is a leading method for studying long-time dynamics and elasticity of biomolecules. The method proceeds from complex semiempirical potentials characterizing the covalent and noncovalent interactions between atoms. It is widely accepted that such detailed potentials are essential to the success of NMA's. We show that a single-parameter potential is sufficient to reproduce the slow dynamics in good detail. Costly and inaccurate energy minimizations are eliminated, permitting direct analysis of crystal coordinates. The technique can be used for new applications, such as mapping of one crystal form to another by means of slow modes, and studying anomalous dynamics of large proteins and complexes.},

@article{Bhutia2016,
abstract = {The role of plasma membrane transporters in cancer is receiving increasing attention in recent years. Several transporters for essential nutrients are up-regulated in cancer and serve as tumour promoters. Transporters could also function as tumour suppressors. To date, four transporters belonging to the SLC gene family have been identified as tumour suppressors. SLC5A8 is a Na(+)-coupled transporter for monocarboxylates. Among its substrates are the bacterial fermentation products butyrate and propionate and the ubiquitous metabolite pyruvate. The tumour-suppressive function of this transporter relates to the ability of butyrate, propionate and pyruvate to inhibit histone deacetylases (HDAC). SLC5A8 functions as a tumour suppressor in most tissues studied thus far, and provides a molecular link to Warburg effect, a characteristic feature in most cancers. It also links colonic bacteria and dietary fibre to the host. SLC26A3 as a tumour suppressor is restricted to colon; it is a Cl(-)/HCO(-) 3 exchanger, facilitating the efflux of HCO(-) 3 The likely mechanism for the tumour-suppressive function of SLC26A3 is related to intracellular pH regulation. SLC39A1 is a Zn(2+) transporter and its role in tumour suppression has been shown in prostate. Zn(2+) is present at high concentrations in normal prostate where it elicits its tumour-suppressive function. SLC22A18 is possibly an organic cation transporter, but the identity of its physiological substrates is unknown. As such, there is no information on molecular pathways responsible for the tumour-suppressive function of this transporter. It is likely that additional SLC transporters will be discovered as tumour suppressors in the future.},

This is expected to have important consequences for the interpretation of the activity of transport proteins and enzymes. Different minima correspond to changes in the relative orientation ofthe helices coupled with side-chain rearrangements that preserve the close packing of the protein interior. The conformational space sampled by the simulation is similar to that found in the evolutionary development of the globins. Glasslike behavior is expected at low temperatures.

@article{Gur2013,
abstract = {The Anton supercomputing technology recently developed for efficient molecular dynamics simulations permits us to examine micro- to milli-second events at full atomic resolution for proteins in explicit water and lipid bilayer. It also permits us to investigate to what extent the collective motions predicted by network models (that have found broad use in molecular biophysics) agree with those exhibited by full-atomic long simulations. The present study focuses on Anton trajectories generated for two systems: the bovine pancreatic trypsin inhibitor, and an archaeal aspartate transporter, GltPh. The former, a thoroughly studied system, helps benchmark the method of comparative analysis, and the latter provides new insights into the mechanism of function of glutamate transporters. The principal modes of motion derived from both simulations closely overlap with those predicted for each system by the anisotropic network model (ANM). Notably, the ANM modes define the collective mechanisms, or the pathways on conformational energy landscape, that underlie the passage between the crystal structure and substates visited in simulations. In particular, the lowest frequency ANM modes facilitate the conversion between the most probable substates, lending support to the view that easy access to functional substates is a robust determinant of evolutionarily selected native contact topology.},
