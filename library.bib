abstract = {Secondary active transporters, such as those that adopt the leucine-transporter fold, are found in all domains of life, and they have the unique capability of harnessing the energy stored in ion gradients to accumulate small molecules essential for life as well as expel toxic and harmful compounds. How these proteins couple ion binding and transport to the concomitant flow of substrates is a fundamental structural and biophysical question that is beginning to be answered at the atomistic level with the advent of high-resolution structures of transporters in different structural states. Nonetheless, the dynamic character of the transporters, such as ion/substrate binding order and how binding triggers conformational change, is not revealed from static structures, yet it is critical to understanding their function. Here, we report a series of molecular simulations carried out on the sugar transporter vSGLT that lend insight into how substrate and ions are released from the inward-facing state of the transporter. Our simulations reveal that the order of release is stochastic. Functional experiments were designed to test this prediction on the human homolog, hSGLT1, and we also found that cytoplasmic release is not ordered, but we confirmed that substrate and ion binding from the extracellular space is ordered. Our findings unify conflicting published results concerning cytoplasmic release of ions and substrate and hint at the possibility that other transporters in the superfamily may lack coordination between ions and substrate in the inward-facing state.},

SCOP2 is a successor to the Structural Classification of Proteins (SCOP, http://scop.mrc-lmb.cam.ac.uk/scop/) database. Similarly to SCOP, the main focus of SCOP2 is to organize structurally characterized proteins according to their structural and evolutionary relationships. SCOP2 was designed to provide a more advanced framework for protein structure annotation and classification. It defines a new approach to the classification of proteins that is essentially different from SCOP, but retains its best features. The SCOP2 classification is described in terms of a directed acyclic graph in which nodes form a complex network of many-to-many relationships and are represented by a region of protein structure and sequence. The new classification project is expected to ensure new advances in the field and open new areas of research.},

In these respects tight turns are being studied in detail. They also represent template structures for the design of new molecules such as drugs, pesticides, or antigens. Isolated alpha-turns, not participating in alpha-helical structures, have received little attention due to the overwhelming presence of other types of tight turns in peptide and protein structures. The growing number of protein X-ray structures allowed us to undertake a systematic search into the Protein Data Bank of this uncharacterized protein secondary structure. A classification of isolated alpha-turns into different types, based on conformational similarity, is reported here. A preliminary analysis on the occurrence of some particular amino acids in certain positions of the turned structure is also presented.},

This is expected to have important consequences for the interpretation of the activity of transport proteins and enzymes. Different minima correspond to changes in the relative orientation ofthe helices coupled with side-chain rearrangements that preserve the close packing of the protein interior. The conformational space sampled by the simulation is similar to that found in the evolutionary development of the globins. Glasslike behavior is expected at low temperatures.

The use of normal modes in the study of these motions is often extremely fruitful since many of the functional motions of large proteins can be described using just a few normal modes which are intimately related to the overall structure of the protein. In this review, we present a broad overview of several popular methods used in the study of normal modes in biological physics including continuum elastic theory, the elastic network model, and a new all-atom method, recently developed, which is capable of computing a subset of the low frequency vibrational modes exactly. After a review of the various methods, we present several examples of applications of normal modes in the study of functional motions, with an emphasis on viral capsids.},

abstract = {Geometrical validation around the Calpha is described, with a new Cbeta measure and updated Ramachandran plot. Deviation of the observed Cbeta atom from ideal position provides a single measure encapsulating the, major structure-validation information contained in bond angle distortions. Cbeta deviation is sensitive to incompatibilities between sidechain And backbone caused by misfit conformations or inappropriate refinement restraints. A new phi,psi plot using density-dependent smoothing for 81,234 non-Gly, non-Pro, and non-prePro residues with B {\textless} 30 from 500 high-resolution proteins shows sharp boundaries at critical edges and clear delineation between large empty areas and regions that are allowed but disfavored. One such region is the gamma-turn conformation near +75degrees,-60degrees, counted as forbidden by common structure-validation programs; however, it occurs in well-ordered parts of good structures, it is overrepresented near functional sites, and strain is partly compensated by the gamma-turn H-bond. Favored and allowed phi,psi regions are also defined for Pro, prePro, and Gly (important because Gly phi,psi angles are more permissive but less accurately determined). Details of these accurate empirical distributions are poorly predicted by previous theoretical calculations, including a region left of alpha-helix, which rates as favorable in energy yet rarely occurs. A proposed factor explaining this discrepancy is that crowding of the two-peptide NHs permits donating only a single H-bond. New calculations by Hu et al. [Proteins 2002 (this issue)] for Ala and Gly dipeptides, using mixed quantum mechanics and molecular mechanics, fit our nonrepetitive data in excellent detail.

To use the elastic model approach further for developing the details of protein mechanisms, it becomes essential to expand this model to include the added details of the directions of individual residue fluctuations.

abstract = {The Anton supercomputing technology recently developed for efficient molecular dynamics simulations permits us to examine micro- to milli-second events at full atomic resolution for proteins in explicit water and lipid bilayer. It also permits us to investigate to what extent the collective motions predicted by network models (that have found broad use in molecular biophysics) agree with those exhibited by full-atomic long simulations. The present study focuses on Anton trajectories generated for two systems: the bovine pancreatic trypsin inhibitor, and an archaeal aspartate transporter, GltPh. The former, a thoroughly studied system, helps benchmark the method of comparative analysis, and the latter provides new insights into the mechanism of function of glutamate transporters. The principal modes of motion derived from both simulations closely overlap with those predicted for each system by the anisotropic network model (ANM). Notably, the ANM modes define the collective mechanisms, or the pathways on conformational energy landscape, that underlie the passage between the crystal structure and substates visited in simulations. In particular, the lowest frequency ANM modes facilitate the conversion between the most probable substates, lending support to the view that easy access to functional substates is a robust determinant of evolutionarily selected native contact topology.},

abstract = {Glucose is a major metabolic substrate required for cancer cell survival and growth. It is mainly imported into cells by facilitated glucose transporters (GLUTs). Here we demonstrate the importance of another glucose import system, the sodium-dependent glucose transporters (SGLTs), in pancreatic and prostate adenocarcinomas, and investigate their role in cancer cell survival. Three experimental approaches were used: (i) immunohistochemical mapping of SGLT1 and SGLT2 distribution in tumors; (ii) measurement of glucose uptake in fresh isolated tumors using an SGLT-specific radioactive glucose analog, $\alpha$-methyl-4-deoxy-4-[(18)F]fluoro-D-glucopyranoside (Me4FDG), which is not transported by GLUTs; and (iii) measurement of in vivo SGLT activity in mouse models of pancreatic and prostate cancer using Me4FDG-PET imaging. We found that SGLT2 is functionally expressed in pancreatic and prostate adenocarcinomas, and provide evidence that SGLT2 inhibitors block glucose uptake and reduce tumor growth and survival in a xenograft model of pancreatic cancer. We suggest that Me4FDG-PET imaging may be used to diagnose and stage pancreatic and prostate cancers, and that SGLT2 inhibitors, currently in use for treating diabetes, may be useful for cancer therapy.},

abstract = {Biomolecular conformational transitions are essential to biological functions. Most experimental methods report on the long-lived functional states of biomolecules, but information about the transition pathways between these stable states is generally scarce. Such transitions involve short-lived conformational states that are difficult to detect experimentally. For this reason, computational methods are needed to produce plausible hypothetical transition pathways that can then be probed experimentally. Here we propose a simple and computationally efficient method, called ANMPathway, for constructing a physically reasonable pathway between two endpoints of a conformational transition. We adopt a coarse-grained representation of the protein and construct a two-state potential by combining two elastic network models (ENMs) representative of the experimental structures resolved for the endpoints. The two-state potential has a cusp hypersurface in the configuration space where the energies from both the ENMs are equal. We first search for the minimum energy structure on the cusp hypersurface and then treat it as the transition state. The continuous pathway is subsequently constructed by following the steepest descent energy minimization trajectories starting from the transition state on each side of the cusp hypersurface. Application to several systems of broad biological interest such as adenylate kinase, ATP-driven calcium pump SERCA, leucine transporter and glutamate transporter shows that ANMPathway yields results in good agreement with those from other similar methods and with data obtained from all-atom molecular dynamics simulations, in support of the utility of this simple and efficient approach. Notably the method provides experimentally testable predictions, including the formation of non-native contacts during the transition which we were able to detect in two of the systems we studied. An open-access web server has been created to deliver ANMPathway results.},

abstract = {The recent determination of high-resolution crystal structures of several transporters offers unprecedented insights into the structural mechanisms behind secondary transport. These proteins utilize the facilitated diffusion of the ions down their electrochemical gradients to transport the substrate against its concentration gradient. The structural studies revealed striking similarities in the structural organization of ion and solute binding sites and a well-conserved inverted-repeat topology between proteins from several gene families. In this paper we will overview recent atomistic simulations applied to study the mechanisms of selective binding of ion and substrate in LeuT, Glt, vSGLT and hSERT as well as its consequences for the transporter conformational dynamics.

abstract = {It is well accepted that cotransporters facilitate water movement by two independent mechanisms: osmotic flow through a water channel in the protein and flow driven by ion/substrate cotransport. However, the molecular mechanism of transport-linked water flow is controversial. Some researchers believe that it occurs via cotransport, in which water is pumped along with the transported cargo, while others believe that flow is osmotic in response to an increase in intracellular osmolarity. In this letter, we report the results of a 200-ns molecular dynamics simulation of the sodium-dependent galactose cotransporter vSGLT. Our simulation shows that a significant number of water molecules cross the protein through the sugar-binding site in the presence as well as the absence of galactose, and 70-80 water molecules accompany galactose as it moves from the binding site into the intracellular space. During this event, the majority of water molecules in the pathway are unable to diffuse around the galactose, resulting in water in the inner half of the transporter being pushed into the intracellular space and replaced by extracellular water. Thus, our simulation supports the notion that cotransporters act as both passive water channels and active water pumps with the transported substrate acting as a piston to rectify the motion of water. ?? 2010 by the Biophysical Society.},

abstract = {The role of plasma membrane transporters in cancer is receiving increasing attention in recent years. Several transporters for essential nutrients are up-regulated in cancer and serve as tumour promoters. Transporters could also function as tumour suppressors. To date, four transporters belonging to the SLC gene family have been identified as tumour suppressors. SLC5A8 is a Na(+)-coupled transporter for monocarboxylates. Among its substrates are the bacterial fermentation products butyrate and propionate and the ubiquitous metabolite pyruvate. The tumour-suppressive function of this transporter relates to the ability of butyrate, propionate and pyruvate to inhibit histone deacetylases (HDAC). SLC5A8 functions as a tumour suppressor in most tissues studied thus far, and provides a molecular link to Warburg effect, a characteristic feature in most cancers. It also links colonic bacteria and dietary fibre to the host. SLC26A3 as a tumour suppressor is restricted to colon; it is a Cl(-)/HCO(-) 3 exchanger, facilitating the efflux of HCO(-) 3 The likely mechanism for the tumour-suppressive function of SLC26A3 is related to intracellular pH regulation. SLC39A1 is a Zn(2+) transporter and its role in tumour suppression has been shown in prostate. Zn(2+) is present at high concentrations in normal prostate where it elicits its tumour-suppressive function. SLC22A18 is possibly an organic cation transporter, but the identity of its physiological substrates is unknown. As such, there is no information on molecular pathways responsible for the tumour-suppressive function of this transporter. It is likely that additional SLC transporters will be discovered as tumour suppressors in the future.},

abstract = {Analysis of extended molecular dynamics (MD) simulations of lysozyme in vacuo and in aqueous solution reveals that it is possible to separate the configurational space into two subspaces: (1) an "essential" subspace containing only a few degrees of freedom in which anharmonic motion occurs that comprises most of the positional fluctuations; and (2) the remaining space in which the motion has a narrow Gaussian distribution and which can be considered as "physically constrained." If overall translation and rotation are eliminated, the two spaces can be constructed by a simple linear transformation in Cartesian coordinate space, which remains valid over several hundred picoseconds. The transformation follows from the covariance matrix of the positional deviations. The essential degrees of freedom seem to describe motions which are relevant for the function of the protein, while the physically constrained subspace merely describes irrelevant local fluctuations. The near-constraint behavior of the latter subspace allows the separation of equations of motion and promises the possibility of investigating independently the essential space and performing dynamic simulations only in this reduced space.},

abstract = {Sodium-Galactose Transporter (SGLT) is a secondary active symporter which accumulates sugars into cells by using the electrochemical gradient of Na+ across the membrane. Previous computational studies provided insights into the release process of the two ligands (galactose and sodium ion) into the cytoplasm from the inward-facing conformation of Vibrio parahaemolyticus sodium/galactose transporter (vSGLT). Several aspects of the transport mechanism of this symporter remain to be clarified: (i) a detailed kinetic and thermodynamic characterization of the exit path of the two ligands is still lacking; (ii) contradictory conclusions have been drawn concerning the gating role of Y263; (iii) the role of Na+ in modulating the release path of galactose is not clear. In this work, we use bias-exchange metadynamics simulations to characterize the free energy profile of the galactose and Na+ release processes toward the intracellular side. Surprisingly, we find that the exit of Na+ and galactose is non-concerted as the cooperativity between the two ligands is associated to a transition that is not rate limiting. The dissociation barriers are of the order of 11-12 kcal/mol for both the ion and the substrate, in line with kinetic information concerning this type of transporters. On the basis of these results we propose a branched six-state alternating access mechanism, which may be shared also by other members of the LeuT-fold transporters.},

abstract = {Based in part on the previous version of this eLS article 'Normal Mode Analysis Techniques in Structural Biology' (2007) by Osamu Miyashita and Florence Tama. The dynamic simulation of macromolecular systems with biologically relevant sizes and time scales is critical for understanding macromolecular function. In this context, normal mode analysis (NMA) approximates the complex dynamical behaviour of a macromolecule as a simple set of harmonic oscillators vibrating around a given equilibrium conformation. This technique, originated from classical mechanics, was first applied to investigate the dynamical properties of small biological systems more than 30 years ago. During this time, a wealth of evidence has accumu-lated to support NMA as a successful tool for simulating macromolecular motions at extended length scales. Today, NMA combined with coarse-grained representa-tions has become an efficient alternative to molecular dynamics simulations for studying the slow and large-amplitude motions of macromolecular machines. Inter-esting insights into these systems can be obtained very quickly with NMA to characterise their flexibility, to pre-dict the directions of their collective conformational changes, or to help in the interpretation of experimental structural data. The recently developed methods and applications of NMA together with an introduction of the underlying theory will be briefly reviewed here.},

The validation of the resulting complexes was evaluated by molecular dynamics simulations. Our results show that that changes of non-aromatic amino acids in PDGFRalpha to aromatic amino acids in PDGFRbeta (I139F, P267F and N204Y) may be involved in the promiscuity of PDGFRalpha.

abstract = {The Na(+)/galactose cotransporter (vSGLT) of Vibrio parahaemolyticus, tagged with C-terminal hexahistidine, has been purified to apparent homogeneity by Ni(2+) affinity chromatography and gel filtration. Resequencing the vSGLT gene identified an important correction: the N terminus constitutes an additional 13 functionally essential residues. The mass of His-tagged vSGLT expressed under its native promoter, as determined by electrospray ionization-mass spectrometry (ESI-MS), verifies these 13 residues in wild-type vSGLT. A fusion protein of vSGLT and green fluorescent protein, comprising a mass of over 90 kDa, was also successfully analyzed by ESI-MS. Reconstitution of purified vSGLT yields proteoliposomes active in Na(+)-dependent galactose uptake, with sugar preferences (galactose {\textgreater} glucose {\textgreater} fucose) reflecting those of wild-type vSGLT in vivo. Substrates are transported with apparent 1:1 stoichiometry and apparent K(m) values of 129 mm (Na(+)) and 158 microm (galactose). Freeze-fracture electron microscopy of functional proteoliposomes shows intramembrane particles of a size consistent with vSGLT existing as a monomer. We conclude that vSGLT is a suitable model for the study of sugar cotransporter mechanisms and structure, with potential applicability to the larger SGLT family of important sodium:solute cotransporters. It is further demonstrated that ESI-MS is a powerful tool for the study of proteomics of membrane transporters.},

In repeated molecular dynamics simulations, however, we find the Na+ ion instable, invariably and spontaneously diffusing out of the transporter through a pathway lined by D189, which appears to facilitate the diffusion of the ion toward the cytoplasm. Further analysis of the trajectories and close structural examination, in particular, comparison of the Na+-binding sites of vSGLT and LeuT, strongly indicates that the crystal structure of vSGLT actually represents an ion-releasing state of the transporter. The observed dynamics of the Na+ ion, in contrast to the substrate, also suggests that the cytoplasmic release of the Na+ ion precedes that of the substrate, thus shedding light on a key step in the transport cycle of this secondary transporter. {\textcopyright} 2009 by the Biophysical Society.},

abstract = {Membrane co-transport proteins that use a five-helix inverted repeat motif have recently emerged as one of the largest structural classes of secondary active transporters. However, despite many structural advances there is no clear evidence of how ion and substrate transport are coupled. Here we report a comprehensive study of the sodium/galactose transporter from Vibrio parahaemolyticus (vSGLT), consisting of molecular dynamics simulations, biochemical characterization and a new crystal structure of the inward-open conformation at a resolution of 2.7 {\AA}. Our data show that sodium exit causes a reorientation of transmembrane helix 1 that opens an inner gate required for substrate exit, and also triggers minor rigid-body movements in two sets of transmembrane helical bundles. This cascade of events, initiated by sodium release, ensures proper timing of ion and substrate release. Once set in motion, these molecular changes weaken substrate binding to the transporter and allow galactose readily to enter the intracellular space. Additionally, we identify an allosteric pathway between the sodium-binding sites, the unwound portion of transmembrane helix 1 and the substrate-binding site that is essential in the coupling of co-transport.},

abstract = {This note has no new results and is therefore not intended to be submitted to a " research " journal in the foreseeable future, but to be available to the numerous individuals who are interested in this issue. The Debye-Waller factor is the ratio of the coherent scattering or absorption cross section of a photon or electron by particles bound in a complex system to the value for the same process on an analgous free particle. It is often interpreted also as the probability of the coherent process, normalized to unity, with the difference between unity and the Debye Waller factor interpreted as the probability of incoherent processes. The Debye-Waller factor is then interpreted as a measure of decoherence. The breakdown of this description for a test particle which cannot give or lose energy is not generally appreciated. Prime examples are: Bragg scattering, the M{\"{o}}ssbauer effect and related phenomena at zero temperature. The physics of the change in the interpretation of the Debye-Waller factor is summarized here in a hopefully pedagogical manner.},

abstract = {The small intestine is void of aquaporins adept at facilitating vectorial water transport and yet it reabsorbs about eight liters of fluid daily. Implications of the sodium glucose cotransporter SGLT1 in either pumping water or passively channeling water, contrast with its reported water transporting capacity, which lags behind that of aquaporin-1 by three orders of magnitude. Here we overexpressed SGLT1 in MDCK cell monolayers and reconstituted the purified transporter into proteoliposomes. We observed the rate of osmotic proteoliposome deflation by light scattering. Fluorescence correlation spectroscopy served to assess (i) SGLT1 abundance in both vesicles and plasma membranes and (ii) flow-mediated dilution of an aqueous dye adjacent to the cell monolayer. Calculation of the unitary water channel permeability, pf, yielded similar values for cell and proteoliposome experiments. Neither the absence of glucose or Na+, nor the lack of membrane voltage in vesicles, nor the directionality of water flow grossly altered pf. Such weak dependence on protein conformation indicates that a water-impermeable occluded state (glucose and Na+ in their binding pockets) lasts for only a minor fraction of the transport cycle or, alternatively, that occlusion of the substrate does not render the transporter water-impermeable as was suggested by computational studies of the bacterial homologue vSGLT. While the similarity between the pf values of SGLT1 and aquaporin-1 makes a transcellular pathway plausible, it renders water pumping physiologically negligible as the passive flux would be orders of magnitude larger.},

A framework for interpreting the wealth of experimental data for non-native states emerging from rapid advances in experimental techniques involves comparison with a "random coll' state, which possesses no structure except that inherent in the local interactions. We review here the concept of a random coil, from its global to its local properties. In particular, we focus on the description of a random coil in terms of statistical distributions in psi, phi space. We show that such a model, in combination with experimental data, provides insight into the structural properties of polypeptide chains and has significance for understanding protein folding and for molecular design.},

abstract = {The sodium/iodide symporter (NIS or SLC5A5) is an intrinsic membrane protein implicated in iodide uptake into thyroid follicular cells. It plays a crucial role in iodine metabolism and thyroid regulation and its function is widely exploited in the diagnosis and treatment of benign and malignant thyroid diseases. A great effort is currently being made to develop a NIS-based gene therapy also allowing the radiotreatment of nonthyroidal tumors. NIS is also expressed in other tissues, such as salivary gland, stomach and mammary gland during lactation, where its physiological role remains unclear. The molecular identity of the thyroid iodide transporter was elucidated approximately fifteen years ago. It belongs to the superfamily of sodium/solute symporters, SSS (and to the human transporter family, SLC5), and is composed of 13 transmembrane helices and 643 amino acid residues in humans. Knowledge concerning NIS structure/function relationship has been obtained by taking advantage of the high resolution structure of one member of the SSS family, the Vibrio parahaemolyticus sodium/galactose symporter (vSGLT), and from studies of gene mutations leading to congenital iodine transport defects (ITD). This review will summarize current knowledge regarding the molecular characterization of NIS. ?? 2013 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {Normal modes analysis (NMA) has been a valuable tool for the study of the flexibility and the slow range of motion of proteins, and it nicely complements Molecular Dynamics techniques, where simulations are possible for only limited time spans. We demonstrate the usefulness of NMA by the example of a large globular protein, G-actin, and the filaments it forms: F-actin. We also discuss some less known aspects of NMA: (a) The density of modes of globular proteins departs from Debye's prediction for solids, and is anomalous. (b) The use of dihedral angles, rather than Cartesian degrees of freedom, gives rise to interesting nonlinear effects, such as oscillations of certain subsets at twice the natural frequency of the mode. (c) For slow modes of macromolecules it is sufficient to use very simple-minded potentials, without the rich level of details habitual in NMA and Molecular Dynamics.},

abstract = {The ability to generate, visualize, and analyze motions of biomolecules has made a significant impact upon modern biology. Molecular Dynamics has gained substantial use, but remains computationally demanding and difficult to setup for many biologists. Elastic network models (ENMs) are an alternative and have been shown to generate the dominant equilibrium motions of biomolecules quickly and efficiently. These dominant motions have been shown to be functionally relevant and also to indicate the likely direction of conformational changes. Most structures have a small number of dominant motions. Comparing computed motions to the structure's conformational ensemble derived from a collection of static structures or frames from an MD trajectory is an important way to understand functional motions as well as evaluate the models. Modes of motion computed from ENMs can be visualized to gain functional and mechanistic understanding and to compute useful quantities such as average positional fluctuations, internal distance changes, collectiveness of motions, and directional correlations within the structure.},

Here, we focus on vdW heterostructures composed of graphene and gallium nitride (GaN). Using density functional theory, we perform a systematic study on the structural and electronic properties of heterostructures consisting of graphene and GaN. Small band gaps are opened up at or near the $\Gamma$ point of the Brillouin zone for all of the heterostructures. We also investigate the effect of the stacking sequence and electric fields on their electronic properties. Our results show that the tunability of the band gap is sensitive to the stacking sequence in bilayer-graphene-based heterostructures. In particular, in the case of graphene/graphene/GaN, a band gap of up to 334 meV is obtained under a perpendicular electric field. The band gap of bilayer graphene between GaN sheets (GaN/graphene/graphene/GaN) shows similar tunability, and increases to 217 meV with the perpendicular electric field reaching 0.8 V Å − 1.},

abstract = {We investigate the mechanical properties of proposed graphene-like hexagonal gallium nitride monolayer (g-GaN) using first-principles calculations based on densityfunctional theory. Compared to the graphene-like hexagonal boron nitride monolayer (g-BN), g-GaN is softer, with 40 {\%} in-plane stiffness, 50 {\%}, 46 {\%}, and 42 {\%} ultimate strengths in armchair, zigzag, and biaxial strains, respectively. However, g-GaN has a larger Poisson's ratio, 0.43, about 1.9 times that of g-BN. It was found that the g-GaN also sustains much smaller strains before rupture. We obtained the second-, third-, fourth-, and fifth-order elastic constants for a rigorous continuum description of the elastic response of g-GaN. The second-order elastic constants, including inplane stiffness, are predicted to monotonically increase with pressure while the Poisson's ratio monotonically decreases with increasing pressure. The sound velocity of a compressional wave has a minima of 10 km/s at an in-plane pressure of 1 N/m, while as a shear wave's velocity monotonically increases with pressure. The tunable sound velocities have promising applications in nano waveguides and surface acoustic wave sensors. {\textcopyright} 2013 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.},
